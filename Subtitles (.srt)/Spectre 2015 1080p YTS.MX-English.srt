1
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,765
Where are you going?

2
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,485
I won't be long.

3
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,483
Welcome, Signor Sciarra.

4
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,048
I trust you had a pleasant journey.

5
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,367
Do you have it?

6
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,889
Yes. It's over there.

7
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,081
When do we blow the stadium?

8
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,487
This evening at six.

9
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,562
And the flight out of here?

10
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,244
All arranged.

11
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,685
And then what?

12
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,050
Then I visit The Pale King.

13
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,848
A toast, my friend.

14
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,927
To Death!

15
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,406
Bottoms up.

16
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,521
Meet me in the square!

17
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,724
<i>I've been here before.</i>

18
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,203
<i>But always hit the floor.</i>

19
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,601
<i>I've spent a lifetime running.</i>

20
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:26,365
<i>And I always get away.</i>

21
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,125
<i>But with you
I'm feeling something.</i>

22
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,885
<i>That makes me want to stay.</i>

23
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,246
<i>If I risk it all.</i>

24
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,561
<i>Could you break my fall?</i>

25
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,801
<i>How do I live? How do I breathe?</i>

26
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:55,248
<i>When you're not here
I'm suffocating.</i>

27
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,846
<i>I want to feel love
run through my blood.</i>

28
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:02,765
<i>Tell me is this
where I give it all up?</i>

29
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:10,086
<i>For you I have to risk it all</i>

30
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,124
<i>'Cause the writing's on the wall.</i>

31
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,441
<i>A million shards of glass.</i>

32
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,726
<i>That haunt me from my past.</i>

33
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,726
<i>As the stars begin to gather.</i>

34
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:43,407
<i>And the light begins to fade.</i>

35
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,040
<i>When all hope begins to shatter.</i>

36
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,250
<i>Know that I won't be afraid.</i>

37
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:58,447
<i>If I risk it all.</i>

38
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,366
<i>Could you break my fall?</i>

39
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,441
<i>How do I live? How do I breathe?</i>

40
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,966
<i>When you're not here
I'm suffocating.</i>

41
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:15,760
<i>I want to feel love
run through my blood.</i>

42
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,924
<i>Tell me is this
where I give it all up?</i>

43
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,360
<i>For you I have to risk it all</i>

44
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:33,370
<i>'Cause the writing's on the wall.</i>

45
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:42,846
<i>The writing's on the wall.</i>

46
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,604
<i>How do I live? How do I breathe?</i>

47
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,162
<i>When you're not here
I'm suffocating.</i>

48
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,086
<i>I want to feel love
run through my blood.</i>

49
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:14,403
<i>Tell me is this
where I give it all up?</i>

50
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:21,759
<i>For you I have to risk it all</i>

51
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:29,927
<i>'Cause the writing's on.</i>

52
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:38,249
<i>The wall.</i>

53
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,644
Start anywhere you like.

54
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,761
Take your time, 007,
but in five minutes

55
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,046
the head of
the Joint Security Service

56
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,360
is going to walk
through that door,

57
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,645
and I've got to explain to him

58
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,962
how one of our agents decided
to potter off to Mexico, all on his own,

59
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,724
and cause
an international incident.

60
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,006
With all due respect, sir,
it could've been worse.

61
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,201
Worse? You blew up
half a bloody block.

62
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,759
Well, better half a block than
a whole stadium full of people.

63
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,962
You had no authority.

64
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,601
None.

65
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,842
As you know, we're in the
middle of the biggest shakeup

66
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,444
in the history of
British intelligence.

67
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,285
The ink's barely dry
on this merger with MI5

68
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,169
and already they're itching
for a chance to scrap

69
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,890
the double-0 program forever.

70
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,247
And you've just given them one.

71
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,683
You're right, sir.

72
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,366
You have got a tricky day ahead.

73
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,480
This is an official question.

74
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,802
Mexico City.
What were you doing there?

75
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,440
It was just a coincidence.
I was taking some overdue holiday.

76
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,650
Okay. Fine.

77
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:45,971
As of this morning,
you are officially grounded.

78
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:49,681
I'm standing you down
from all operations indefinitely.

79
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,444
Very good, sir.

80
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,805
007?

81
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,366
Sir?

82
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,205
I don't know what
you're playing at,

83
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:08,931
but whatever it is,
it has to stop.

84
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Now.

85
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,521
So sorry. Am I interrupting?
Not remotely.

86
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,567
007, I'd like you
to meet Max Denbigh,

87
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,005
head of the Joint
Security Service.

88
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:20,799
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, 007.
I've heard a lot about you.

89
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,000
Most of it good.

90
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,565
Congratulations
on your new appointment.

91
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
Thank you.

92
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,204
I suppose we should
call you C now.

93
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,202
No, no. "Max," please.

94
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,801
No, I think I'll call you C,

95
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,921
C.

96
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,170
As you wish.

97
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,039
Well, my door is always open, 007,
for my employees.

98
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,009
This merger's gonna be
a whole new chapter for us.

99
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,800
We're going to bring
British intelligence out of the Dark Ages

100
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,450
into the light.

101
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,650
That all sounds lovely.

102
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,883
That'll be all, 007. Report to Q
tomorrow for medical, thank you.

103
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,730
Very good, sir.

104
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,806
James?

105
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,881
Moneypenny.

106
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,520
So? How was the meeting?

107
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,409
Very good, thank you.

108
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:12,807
Here.

109
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,048
Forensics finally released this.
What is it?

110
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,169
It's personal effects
they recovered from Skyfall.

111
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,048
Perfect. You can
bring it to me later.

112
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,566
What do you mean?
My place, 9:00.

113
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,205
Evening.

114
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,559
Come in.

115
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,363
Have you just moved in?

116
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,441
No.

117
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:45,039
Well, I like what you've done
with the place.

118
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,164
Your delivery.

119
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,605
Thank you.

120
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,806
Would you like a drink?

121
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,440
No, thanks. I'm not staying.

122
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:57,681
That's a shame.

123
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,328
What's going on, James?

124
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,882
There's not one person at MI6
who isn't talking about it.

125
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,611
Talking about what, exactly?

126
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:11,410
That what you did in Mexico
was one step too far.

127
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,169
That you're finished.

128
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,651
And what do you think?

129
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,122
I think you're just
getting started.

130
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,482
I don't know what you mean.

131
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,971
All right.

132
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,367
I think you've got a secret.

133
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,970
And it's something
you won't tell anyone.

134
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,842
Because you don't trust anyone.

135
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,644
<i>If anything happens to me, 007,
I need you to do something.</i>

136
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,442
<i>Find a man called Marco Sciarra.</i>

137
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,891
<i>Kill him.</i>

138
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:56,682
<i>And don't miss the funeral.</i>

139
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,171
Jesus.

140
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,529
Where did you get it?

141
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,079
In my mailbox
just after she died.

142
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,961
Well, she was never
short of surprises.

143
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:12,560
She wasn't gonna let death
get in the way of her job.

144
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:16,965
I've been tracking
Sciarra ever since.

145
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,371
And what have you found?

146
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,803
Nothing significant yet.

147
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,287
When's the funeral?

148
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,567
Three days. In Rome.

149
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,683
If you think M's signing off on that,
you're insane.

150
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,250
He won't let you
out of his sight.

151
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:32,560
Yes, it's a bit of a problem.

152
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,965
Listen.

153
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,324
Could you do a little
quiet digging for me?

154
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:40,411
I heard a name in Mexico.
"The Pale King."

155
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,689
You want me to be your mole.

156
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,487
Yes.

157
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,604
And what makes you think
you can trust me?

158
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,570
Instinct.

159
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,282
Poor old girl.
Rigged for demolition in a week.

160
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,564
Cheaper to knock her down
than to rebuild.

161
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,325
Still.

162
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,880
Time waits for no man
and all that.

163
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,644
Anyway, all the money's
been spent on this,

164
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,244
the New Centre for
National Security.

165
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:20,082
So that's C's new digs.

166
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,924
You've met him, have you?

167
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,127
Yesterday.
What do we know about him?

168
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,362
Classic Whitehall mandarin.

169
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,566
Wrote a dossier last year

170
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,642
on how the double-0 program
was obsolete,

171
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,763
how drones could do
all our dirty work abroad.

172
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,605
Went to school with
the Home Secretary.

173
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,170
Of course, he did.

174
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,527
This merger's
just the start of it.

175
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,921
In three days, there's
a security conference in Tokyo

176
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,240
to decide the New World Order.

177
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,560
If C gets his way,
he'll have unlimited access

178
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,371
to the combined intelligence streams
of nine countries.

179
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,645
Including us.

180
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,881
Quite.

181
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,520
Well, a lot's happened
while you were away.

182
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:06,684
A train bombing in Hamburg
and an industrial explosion in Tunisia.

183
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,211
It's not great timing for us.

184
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:11,125
It's all rather
playing into C's hands.

185
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,125
M, well, let's say
he's feeling the pressure.

186
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:16,891
Yeah, I've noticed.

187
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,769
Now, this way, 007.

188
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:21,319
Be careful.
It's a trifle slippery.

189
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,520
Q wasn't exactly feeling at home
in Whitehall,

190
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:27,601
what with the new merger,

191
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,809
so he set up shop here,
away from prying eyes, as it were.

192
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,723
I hear he's got something rather
special planned for you.

193
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,483
I can hardly wait.

194
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,361
Ah, 007.

195
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:51,922
- Q.
- Please excuse the mess.

196
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:53,486
Everything's a little
bit up in the air,

197
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,846
what with the changes and all.

198
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,240
Couple of things to get through.

199
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,929
Shall we get started?

200
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,891
Just relax.

201
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,721
That's it. Lovely.

202
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,843
Now, you may feel a small...

203
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,967
Christ!

204
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,401
Prick.

205
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,681
What is it?

206
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:14,489
Cutting-edge nanotechnology.

207
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:16,204
Smart Blood.

208
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,367
Microchips in your bloodstream.

209
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,522
Allows us to track
your movements in the field.

210
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,844
You see those readouts?

211
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,601
We can monitor your vital signs
from anywhere on the planet.

212
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,842
Well, that sounds marvelous.

213
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,049
Call it a post-Mexico
insurance policy.

214
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:35,644
By direct order of M.

215
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:39,647
I completely understand.

216
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,286
Good.

217
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:47,249
Right. Well, I've just, um,
got one last thing for you

218
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,890
and you can be on your way.

219
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,722
Magnificent, isn't she?

220
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,401
Zero to 60 in
three point two seconds.

221
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,847
Fully bulletproof.
A few little tricks up her sleeve.

222
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,604
It's a shame, really.
She was meant for you,

223
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,604
but she's been
reassigned to 009.

224
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,808
But you can have this.

225
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,923
Does it do anything?

226
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,683
It tells the time.

227
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,083
Might help with your
punctuality issues.

228
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,048
M's idea? Precisely.

229
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:31,165
Oh, one word of warning.
The alarm is rather loud.

230
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,763
If you know what I mean.

231
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,365
I think I do.

232
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,528
Oh, yes. That old thing
is taking quite a bit of time.

233
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,359
Mind you, there wasn't
much left to work on.

234
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,328
Only a steering wheel.

235
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,689
I believe I said, "Bring it back in one piece,"
not, "Bring back one piece."

236
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:01,648
Anyway, enjoy
your downtime, 007.

237
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,644
- Q?
- Yes?

238
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,240
Well, now you know exactly
where I am all of the time.

239
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,203
Will you do something for me?

240
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,726
What do you have
in mind, exactly?

241
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,045
Make me disappear.

242
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:24,642
May I remind you that
I answer directly to M.

243
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,804
I also have a mortgage.
And two cats to feed.

244
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,565
Well, then I suggest
you trust me,

245
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,923
for the sake of the cats.

246
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,483
Well, it's lovely to
see you, 007. Lovely.

247
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,006
Um, now, I meant to tell you,

248
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,925
the Smart Blood program is obviously
still in its developmental phase.

249
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,086
So we may experience the odd drop
in coverage during the first 24 hours...

250
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,528
48 hours after administration,

251
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:59,285
but after that it
should work perfectly.

252
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,483
I'll send you a postcard.

253
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,525
Please, don't.

254
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:33,681
Morning.

255
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:36,411
What's that?
Oh, it's just something from an admirer.

256
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,960
It's not your birthday, is it?

257
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,650
No, sir.

258
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,568
That was last week.

259
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,961
Morning.

260
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:47,885
009 has arrived to pick up the DB10, sir.
He's waiting upstairs.

261
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,802
Oh, good. Yes, fine.

262
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,564
Oh, shit.

263
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,402
I'm sorry for your loss.

264
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,405
You knew my husband?

265
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:18,009
All too briefly.

266
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:20,046
What do you do?

267
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,045
Life insurance.

268
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,564
A little late for that.

269
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,528
For your husband, yes.

270
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,969
But what about you?

271
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:30,965
Me?

272
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,328
I hear the life expectancy
of some widows can be very short.

273
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,641
How can you talk like this?

274
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,163
Can't you see I'm grieving?

275
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,039
No.

276
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,884
What a lovely view.

277
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,322
You're wasting your time.

278
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,409
There are 100 more
that will come after me.

279
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:14,804
All you buy me is five minutes.

280
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,244
Excellent.

281
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,369
Time for a drink.

282
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,969
You killed him,

283
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,085
didn't you?

284
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,445
My husband.

285
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,762
He was an assassin.

286
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,047
Trust me, he won't
take it personally.

287
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,880
You signed my death warrant.
I was respected.

288
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,411
Loyal to a man you hated.

289
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:49,204
He trusted my silence.

290
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,567
With him gone, I'm a dead woman.

291
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,766
I can trust nobody.

292
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,840
I know the feeling well.

293
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,490
Well, I can tell you
that I don't trust you.

294
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:58,688
Well, then you have
impeccable instincts.

295
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,331
If you don't leave now,
we'll die together.

296
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,286
I can think of worse ways to go.

297
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:11,445
Then you're
obviously crazy, Mister...

298
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,565
Bond.

299
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,079
James Bond.

300
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:29,210
These people,

301
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,365
if you just knew
what they could do.

302
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:36,561
The power they have.

303
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,242
Did your husband ever mention
"The Pale King?"

304
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,400
No.

305
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:46,163
The organization,

306
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,568
they hardly ever meet.

307
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,242
But because of what happened
to my husband,

308
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,204
they meet tonight.

309
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,440
Why?

310
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:01,208
To choose a replacement.

311
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,081
Where?

312
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:06,766
The Palazzo Cardenza.

313
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,923
Midnight. Sounds like fun.

314
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,842
I might drop by.

315
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,327
He was obsessed.

316
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,887
He spent more time
with them than with me.

317
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:22,681
Then the man was a fool.

318
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,769
Leaving your number?

319
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,929
I've called
an American friend of mine. Felix.

320
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,646
He'll contact his embassy
and get you out of here.

321
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,284
You'll be safe.

322
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:52,769
Don't go, James.

323
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,483
If you go there,

324
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:58,449
you're crossing over to a place
where there is no mercy.

325
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,045
I have to go.

326
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,641
Identify yourself, asshole.

327
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,320
Who are you?

328
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:02,329
I'm Mickey Mouse. Who are <i>you?</i>

329
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:22,005
Pharmacy sites has provided

330
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,320
an excellent new sales platform.

331
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,804
We have adapted many of them
into clearinghouses for unapproved drugs.

332
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,804
In addition to which,

333
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,485
the latest figures show
that we presently control

334
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:35,880
70% of antimalarial vaccines,

335
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:41,686
34% of H.I.V.,
and 40% of all oncological drugs

336
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,168
across Sub-Saharan Africa.

337
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,920
But we face challenges
from the WHO

338
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,766
in their campaign against
our counterfeit pharmaceuticals.

339
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:55,726
We have now identified
the key individuals to target.

340
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:58,163
We expect the same
success as we had

341
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:00,561
against the Council
on Human Trafficking.

342
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:04,960
Since the board's resignation...

343
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:10,079
we have placed 160,000 migrated females
into the leisure sector.

344
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,847
The impending completion of
the Global Surveillance initiative...

345
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,447
will mean our capability
is second to none...

346
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:23,242
and now is the moment
for aggressive expansion.

347
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:25,284
The news is only good...

348
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:01,248
Don't let me interrupt you.

349
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,081
The news is only good...

350
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,889
Our increased surveillance capability...

351
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,690
means government intelligence agencies...

352
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,762
are easily counteracted.

353
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,445
We are winning.

354
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,331
Thank you, Doctor.

355
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,246
Now, on to the matter at hand.

356
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,405
After the success of our attacks
in Hamburg and Tunisia,

357
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,880
the aborted attack
in Mexico City

358
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,885
and the death of our valued colleague,
Marco Sciarra,

359
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,048
leaves one of his duties
outstanding.

360
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,568
<i>Signor</i> Guerra,
The Pale King must be terminated.

361
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:50,971
Will you make
the journey to Altaussee?

362
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,961
Of course.

363
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:58,804
My loyalty to this organization is total.

364
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,123
I will protect it with my last breath.

365
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:04,806
There will be no more...

366
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,485
amateurs.

367
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:11,166
No more shows of weakness.

368
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,764
Does anyone challenge
<i>Signor</i> Guerra for this position?

369
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:16,161
Welcome.

370
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:19,005
State your credentials
for succeeding <i>Signor</i> Sciarra.

371
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,364
It's funny.

372
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,005
All that excitement
in Mexico City rang a distant bell.

373
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:24,405
And now,

374
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,202
suddenly, this evening,
it makes perfect sense.

375
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:36,523
Welcome, James.

376
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,083
It's been a long time.

377
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,726
But, finally, here we are.

378
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,762
What took you so long?

379
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:01,244
Cuckoo.

380
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:05,849
Ciao, Mickey Mouse.

381
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,282
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

382
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,521
No.

383
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:55,250
Moneypenny.

384
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:00,240
Bond?

385
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,083
Listen, Moneypenny.
Hamburg, Tunisia,

386
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:03,844
Mexico City, they're all linked.

387
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,605
It's one organization
coordinating multiple attacks.

388
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:08,010
So, she was right.

389
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,240
<i>Of course, she was.</i>

390
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,322
- I ran that check.
- Who is it?

391
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:15,842
Oh, my boss had his
credit card stolen.

392
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,161
It's nothing.
Why don't you go back to sleep.

393
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:19,240
Don't be long.

394
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,923
- Who was that?
<i>- No one.</i>

395
00:47:21,159 --> 00:47:22,400
<i>No, it wasn't.</i>

396
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,686
It's just a friend.

397
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,885
At this time of night?

398
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,088
It's called life, James.
You should try it sometime.

399
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,043
<i>The Pale King. It looks like
you've had dealings with him before.</i>

400
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:39,451
<i>Quantum.</i> Of course.

401
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,521
Mr. White! <i>That's him.</i>

402
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:46,847
Last unconfirmed sighting,
Altaussee in Austria, four months ago.

403
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:48,606
Hold that thought.

404
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,447
You still there? Yeah.

405
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:04,885
Run another name, will you?

406
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,802
Okay. Go.

407
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,804
A man called
Franz Oberhauser. He's...

408
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,405
And check his files
before and after his death.

409
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,244
After his death?
What are you talking about?

410
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,242
Please, just do it.

411
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:46,440
Okay, Q, give me something.

412
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,164
That's more like it.

413
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,481
Here goes nothing.

414
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,570
Good evening.

415
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,088
<i>Do not let them tell you
we need less surveillance.</i>

416
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,005
<i>We need more. Much more.</i>

417
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,971
<i>I say again, the Nine Eyes committee
would have full access</i>

418
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:17,248
<i>to the combined intelligence streams
of all member states.</i>

419
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,481
<i>More data, more analysis,</i>

420
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,730
<i>less likelihood of
a terrorist attack.</i>

421
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,085
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

422
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:27,811
<i>it's time for the security services
of the world to unite.</i>

423
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:31,324
<i>Alone, we are weak.</i>

424
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,244
<i>Together, we're a global power.</i>

425
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:37,170
An unelected one.

426
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:39,971
<i>Thank you.</i>

427
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:42,360
Thank you.

428
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:45,128
We will now vote
on the resolution.

429
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:48,523
Ladies and gentlemen,
please cast your vote.

430
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,882
The vote is eight
to one in favor.

431
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,009
However, as you know,

432
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,050
we cannot proceed
unless by unanimous vote.

433
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:04,284
The Nine Eyes motion
is therefore not passed.

434
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:06,360
Democracy.

435
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,407
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

436
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:09,800
This evening's session is adjourned.

437
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,320
Yes, sir.

438
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,721
Please, tell me 007
is in London.

439
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,880
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

440
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:32,771
Um, I'll just take
a look now, sir.

441
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,728
Because if he isn't,
you're in deep shit.

442
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:38,248
<i>You've got precisely 10 seconds.</i>

443
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,164
I have him, sir.
He appears to be in Chelsea.

444
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:48,608
Well, I want eyes on him
when I get back, understood?

445
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:51,007
I completely understand,

446
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:53,240
sir.

447
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:48,485
Do me a favor. Make it quick.

448
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,684
Upstairs, Mr. White.

449
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,885
I always knew death would wear
a familiar face,

450
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,449
but not yours.

451
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:09,443
To what do I owe
this pleasure, Mr. Bond?

452
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,126
I was at a meeting recently

453
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:16,088
and your name came up.

454
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:19,170
I'm flattered London is still
talking about me.

455
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:20,730
It wasn't MI6.

456
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,085
It was Rome.

457
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,248
Your team, not mine.

458
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:27,641
Ah.

459
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:36,643
Last month,
I found thallium in my cell phone.

460
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:41,289
It's done its job.
I have a few weeks. Maybe less.

461
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:46,684
So, here we are, Mr. Bond,

462
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,851
two dead men
enjoying the evening.

463
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,085
What did you do?

464
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:53,809
I disobeyed him.

465
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:57,646
I followed him
as far as I could.

466
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,606
He changed.

467
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,246
Oh, I see.

468
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,603
You grew a conscience.

469
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:07,090
Our game is our game. But this?

470
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,320
Women, children...

471
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,251
Well, the thallium would suggest

472
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,367
that he doesn't like you
very much anymore.

473
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,329
And clearly
the feeling is mutual.

474
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,606
So why don't you tell me
how to find him again?

475
00:57:18,679 --> 00:57:19,681
Oh, come on.

476
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,250
Tell me where he is.

477
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,048
He's everywhere.

478
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,407
Everywhere!

479
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,648
He's sitting at your desk,

480
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:30,963
he's kissing your lover,
he's eating supper with your family!

481
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,442
You're protecting someone.

482
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:42,561
Your wife.

483
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:47,882
She left long ago.

484
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:49,931
Your son?

485
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,728
Your daughter.

486
00:57:58,119 --> 00:57:59,644
You won't find her.

487
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:01,210
She's clever.

488
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,409
She's smarter than me.
She knows how to hide.

489
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,480
I can protect her if
you tell me where he is.

490
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:12,844
I can keep her alive.

491
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,081
Yeah.

492
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,239
You have my word.

493
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,525
Your word?

494
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:22,409
The word of an assassin!

495
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,449
That's my word.

496
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,844
<i>L'Américain.</i>

497
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,688
You save her,

498
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,445
she can lead you to <i>L'Américain.</i>
She knows <i>L'Américain.</i>

499
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:14,722
Try the Hoffler Klinik.

500
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:25,969
You're a kite dancing in a hurricane,
Mr. Bond.

501
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:30,320
So long.

502
01:00:23,639 --> 01:00:26,849
I can't deny I'm impressed
you got H.M.G. to cough up for all this.

503
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,400
Good God, the government couldn't
afford this kind of facility.

504
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,170
No, it was benefactors mostly,
from the private sector.

505
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:33,766
When it goes online,

506
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,648
this building will be
the most sophisticated

507
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:37,688
data gathering system
in history.

508
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,764
The world's digital ghost,
available 24/7.

509
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,489
George Orwell's worst nightmare.

510
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:43,721
I'm glad you like it.

511
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:47,083
My commiserations
on losing the Nine Eyes vote.

512
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:48,240
Must have been a blow.

513
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,481
Not really.
Only a matter of time

514
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,800
before the South Africans
see the light.

515
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,121
And you know what they say,
Rome wasn't built in a day.

516
01:00:54,199 --> 01:00:55,201
Day and a half maybe.

517
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:59,402
Look, Max, I know
surveillance is a fact of life.

518
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,610
It's how you use the information
that concerns me,

519
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:05,164
and who is using it.

520
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:07,367
This is what we need to do
to keep the people safe.

521
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:10,766
Double-0 program is prehistoric.

522
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,846
Come on, M. You can't really
tell me that one man in the field

523
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,648
can compete with all of this,

524
01:01:15,719 --> 01:01:18,451
running around out there
with his license to kill.

525
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:21,681
Have you ever had
to kill a man, Max?

526
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,525
Have you?

527
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:27,286
To pull that trigger,
you have to be sure.

528
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,365
Yes, you investigate,
analyze, assess, target.

529
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,568
And then you have
to look him in the eye.

530
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,650
And you make the call.

531
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:41,282
And all the drones, bugs,
cameras, transcripts,

532
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,362
all the surveillance
in the world

533
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,840
can't tell you what to do next.

534
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,528
A license to kill

535
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,123
is also a license not to kill.

536
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,485
I didn't want to
have to do this,

537
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:01,570
but it looks like you still can't
control your agents.

538
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,927
<i>Bond? I ran that check.</i>

539
01:02:06,519 --> 01:02:09,251
<i>Looks like you've had
dealings with him before. Quantum.</i>

540
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,128
<i>Of course. Mr. White!</i>

541
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,643
<i>Last unconfirmed sighting,
Altaussee in Austria.</i>

542
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:16,210
<i>Run another name, will you?</i>

543
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,561
So maybe there's
something to be said

544
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:20,608
for total surveillance
after all.

545
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,887
You watch MI6 agents?

546
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,083
We watch everyone.

547
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,731
Please, take a seat.

548
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,847
I'll be with you
in just a moment.

549
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,286
Please excuse me, Mr. Bond.

550
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:02,079
My name is Dr. Madeleine Swann.

551
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:04,003
Our job today is to
analyze your needs,

552
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:06,606
both psychological and physical.

553
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,409
Hmm, sounds pretty
straightforward.

554
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:12,001
I hope you don't mind.
The view can be distracting.

555
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:13,764
I hadn't noticed.

556
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:22,846
I see you filled out
most of the paperwork.

557
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,126
Just a few questions to
complete your evaluation, if I may.

558
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:29,289
Do you exercise?

559
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:30,880
When I have to.

560
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:34,643
Do you consider your employment to be
psychologically stressful?

561
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:36,721
Sometimes.

562
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,769
How much alcohol do you consume?

563
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:40,925
Too much.

564
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,409
Some broader questions.

565
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,719
As a child, would you say
you were close to your parents?

566
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:50,485
My parents died
when I was young.

567
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,963
Really? How old?

568
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:54,965
Old enough to remember.

569
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,724
How, if I may ask?

570
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,244
It was a climbing accident.

571
01:04:59,079 --> 01:05:00,161
So who brought you up?

572
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:01,730
Someone else.

573
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,719
Humor me.

574
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:08,445
How does one train at Oxford
and the Sorbonne become a consultant,

575
01:05:08,519 --> 01:05:11,568
spend two years with
<i>Médecins Sans Frontières</i>

576
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:13,244
and end up here?

577
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,766
Forgive me,
but anyone might think

578
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,489
you were hiding from something.

579
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,760
You're paying a lot of money
to be here, Mr. Bond.

580
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:25,240
Who's asking the questions,
you or me?

581
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,367
Of course. Carry on.

582
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,730
I see you left this
final question blank.

583
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:35,844
What is your occupation?

584
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:39,719
Well, that's not the sort of thing
that looks good on a form.

585
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,045
And why is that?

586
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,121
I kill people.

587
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,485
Small world?

588
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:50,201
Where is he?

589
01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:52,204
Your father's dead.

590
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,965
Two days ago.

591
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:55,565
How do you know?

592
01:05:55,679 --> 01:05:57,204
Because I was there.

593
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,880
Did you kill him?

594
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,007
I didn't have to.

595
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,369
He did it himself.

596
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:06,204
And you came all the way
just to tell me this?

597
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,251
That my father's dead?

598
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:12,360
I came to tell you that your life is in
danger and I need your help.

599
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:16,240
Why? I made a deal
with him to protect you.

600
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,844
You're lying.

601
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,731
Why would he trust you?

602
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,849
Because he knew that
I needed something in return.

603
01:06:24,239 --> 01:06:25,480
And what was that?

604
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:27,650
To find <i>L'Américain.</i>

605
01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:30,320
This interview is over.

606
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,639
Dr. Swann...

607
01:06:31,719 --> 01:06:35,963
You have 10 minutes to leave the building.
Then I'm calling security.

608
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:41,369
Thank you, Dr. Swann.

609
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:05,164
Can I get you something, sir?

610
01:07:05,239 --> 01:07:07,686
Vodka martini.
Shaken, not stirred.

611
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,365
I'm sorry,
we don't serve alcohol.

612
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,047
I'm really starting
to love this place.

613
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:15,487
He'll have the prolytic
digestive enzyme shake.

614
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:16,847
Certainly.

615
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:18,525
If you've come for the car,

616
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:20,204
I parked it
at the bottom of the Tiber.

617
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,284
Well, not to worry, 007.
It was only a £3,000,000 prototype.

618
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:24,726
Why are you here, Q?

619
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,722
Oh, I just fancied a break,
to be honest.

620
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,643
I've been a tad stressed
at work recently.

621
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,882
What with C's people
crawling all over us

622
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,882
and the fact that M wants my balls
for Christmas decorations.

623
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,121
Get to the point.
The point, 007,

624
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:37,327
is that Franz Oberhauser
is dead.

625
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,889
Dead and buried.

626
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,291
And unless you come back
with me right now,

627
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:43,284
my career and Moneypenny's
will go the same way.

628
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,250
Do you understand?
All hell is breaking loose out there and...

629
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:49,010
I saw him.
You thought you saw him.

630
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:50,650
We've been through the records.

631
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:53,371
He died in an avalanche
with his father 20 years ago.

632
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,407
Yes. I know that.

633
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,925
But I saw him.

634
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,967
He's not someone
I'll ever forget.

635
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,601
So you have a lead?

636
01:08:04,679 --> 01:08:06,443
I have a name. <i>L'Américain.</i>

637
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:09,369
Well, that narrows it down.

638
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,766
Look, I'm sorry, 007,
but time's up.

639
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,887
My whole career
is on the line here.

640
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,405
Either you come back in
and do this through proper channels,

641
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:17,605
or I go directly to M.

642
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:20,364
Do one more thing for me.
Then you're out.

643
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:23,720
Find out what you can from this.

644
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:33,685
I really, really
hate you right now.

645
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:35,569
Thank you, Q.

646
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,847
<i>Monsieur?</i> Now? Please?

647
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,966
Where are you staying?

648
01:08:40,039 --> 01:08:41,121
The Pevsner. Room 12.

649
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:42,439
One hour.

650
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:47,322
Here you are, sir.
One prolytic digestive enzyme shake.

651
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,930
Do me a favor, will you?

652
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,127
Throw that down the toilet.

653
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:52,645
Cut out the middleman.

654
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,444
No! Stay.

655
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:55,844
What do you want?

656
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:00,359
What are you doing?

657
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,649
Can't any of you speak?

658
01:13:30,119 --> 01:13:31,645
Come on!

659
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,604
Argh, don't touch me!

660
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:34,440
Hey!

661
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,849
You need to take a breath and calm down.
You're in shock.

662
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,729
Get away from me! Just get away!

663
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,240
Did it cross your mind
that you led them to me?

664
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:49,966
I haven't got time for this.

665
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,922
You need to tell me everything
you know about <i>L'Américain.</i>

666
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:55,451
Go to hell!

667
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,243
I gave your father my word!

668
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,921
And why should I trust you?
Because my father did?

669
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,926
Because right now, Dr. Swann,

670
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,246
I'm your best chance
of staying alive.

671
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,203
Dr. Swann, Q.

672
01:15:38,279 --> 01:15:40,328
Q, Dr. Swann.

673
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:42,962
Hello. Enchanted.

674
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:47,689
Bond, we need to talk. Alone.

675
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,886
She knows.

676
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,927
But, Bond... She knows.

677
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:52,886
What have you got?

678
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,801
I owe you an apology, 007.

679
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,521
You are onto something.

680
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,841
Oberhauser is still alive.
The ring proves it.

681
01:16:02,279 --> 01:16:04,646
And it seems they were
all part of one organization.

682
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:09,326
Le Chiffre, Quantum, Sciarra,
your friend Mr. Silva.

683
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,368
And do you know
who links them all?

684
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:12,645
Him.

685
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,251
Exactly.

686
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:17,766
This organization,
do you know what it's called?

687
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:19,326
- No.
- Spectre.

688
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:24,247
Its name is Spectre.

689
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,680
How does she know that?

690
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,001
Because my father
was part of it.

691
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,927
Then I think that
you ought to see this.

692
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:33,725
<i>You're looking
at pictures from South Africa right now</i>

693
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,768
<i>of what appears to be
a huge explosion.</i>

694
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,411
Q, go back to London.

695
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,724
M's gonna need your help.
And keep tracking me.

696
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,006
I will.

697
01:16:44,439 --> 01:16:46,646
And, Bond, you have
to find <i>L'Américain.</i>

698
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,728
He's our only link
to Oberhauser.

699
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,131
It's not a person.

700
01:16:52,439 --> 01:16:53,965
It's a place.

701
01:17:59,239 --> 01:18:00,604
Thank you.

702
01:18:32,439 --> 01:18:34,488
This is where they spent
their wedding night.

703
01:18:36,279 --> 01:18:38,282
They came back every year.

704
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:41,088
Then they brought me
with them, too.

705
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,489
He kept coming back,
even after the divorce.

706
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,649
Well, then I'm sorry.

707
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,686
What for?

708
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:09,161
Ah-ha!

709
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,171
What is it?

710
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:14,929
It's your inheritance.

711
01:19:15,399 --> 01:19:17,766
Want some? No, thank you.

712
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,000
You don't know
what you're missing.

713
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,484
This can't be it.

714
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,807
Well, here's to your father.

715
01:19:37,159 --> 01:19:41,688
I promised myself I would never
be hurt by that man again.

716
01:19:43,319 --> 01:19:45,208
I cut off all contact.

717
01:19:46,039 --> 01:19:49,521
I didn't want anything to do
with him or his sick life.

718
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:53,041
And then, with his dying breath

719
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,323
he sends me you.

720
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,170
Ironic, no?

721
01:19:58,239 --> 01:20:00,606
You shouldn't be so hard on him.

722
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,088
The man I just met should
have been dead weeks ago.

723
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:06,925
The only reason his heart
was still beating was you.

724
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:10,890
I'll mourn my father
in my own time, Mr. Bond.

725
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:14,447
And, now, I'm going to bed.

726
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:18,640
Oh.

727
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:26,130
Don't think for one moment
this is where I fall into your arms,

728
01:20:27,079 --> 01:20:29,970
seeking solace
for my dead daddy.

729
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:35,604
You sit there.

730
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:39,083
Keep watch.
That's what you're good at.

731
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:46,804
Come anywhere near me
and I'll kill you.

732
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:48,529
I don't doubt it.

733
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:02,203
Look. There are two of you.

734
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,210
Two Jameses.

735
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,250
Lucky me.

736
01:21:13,399 --> 01:21:15,640
What am I doing here?

737
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:26,211
To liars...

738
01:21:26,279 --> 01:21:28,247
and killers.

739
01:21:28,359 --> 01:21:30,521
To liars...

740
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,601
and killers...

741
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,681
everywhere.

742
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:08,483
Who sent you?

743
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,609
Who are you working for?

744
01:22:51,239 --> 01:22:53,287
Now, where did you go?

745
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:23,769
Of course.

746
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,324
What is it?

747
01:24:51,159 --> 01:24:52,490
Nothing.

748
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,246
What's this?

749
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,529
It's coordinates.

750
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,371
Your father was scanning for
a particular satellite phone.

751
01:25:16,439 --> 01:25:18,521
He was looking for someone.

752
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:22,162
He was looking for him.

753
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:26,371
And he sent me here
to finish the job.

754
01:25:28,359 --> 01:25:30,283
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.

755
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:32,690
I like you alive.

756
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,250
I can look after myself.

757
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:36,048
That's beside the point.

758
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:39,163
I might not be coming back.

759
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,805
I know.

760
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,047
But I want to understand
what happened to my father.

761
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:05,402
So, where was he going?

762
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,331
Nowhere.

763
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,484
Thank you so much. Thanks.
All the very best.

764
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,560
What's going on?

765
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,523
The meeting was brought forward.
Did you not get the message?

766
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,680
No, we didn't.

767
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,039
Shortest meeting I can remember.

768
01:26:31,239 --> 01:26:32,685
South Africans on board,
I take it?

769
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,603
Yeah, well, who can blame them?

770
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:37,247
Nine Eyes is now
officially sanctioned.

771
01:26:37,319 --> 01:26:39,890
The new system goes live
in less than 72 hours.

772
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:41,927
It's a major step forward.

773
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,842
Global intelligence cooperation
changes everything.

774
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,604
As you said before.

775
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:48,565
Look.

776
01:26:49,399 --> 01:26:51,561
They've asked me
to head the new committee.

777
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,529
Yes? And?

778
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:57,207
And I should tell you
I've spoken with the Home Secretary.

779
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:00,045
And in light of the new information
I've given him,

780
01:27:00,119 --> 01:27:03,168
he's decided to close down
the double-0 program with immediate effect.

781
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:04,801
You don't know
what you're doing.

782
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:06,802
It's not personal.

783
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,484
It's the future.

784
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,166
And...

785
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,640
You're not.

786
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,488
You're a cocky little bastard,
aren't you?

787
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,449
I'll take that as a compliment.

788
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,051
I wouldn't.

789
01:27:22,079 --> 01:27:23,809
This isn't over yet.

790
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:45,042
Would you press this for me? Thank you.
Yes, sir.

791
01:28:04,199 --> 01:28:05,564
Pick it up.

792
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,204
I hate guns.

793
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:11,006
I promised him I'd protect you.

794
01:28:11,079 --> 01:28:13,810
The first thing to do is to teach
you how to protect yourself.

795
01:28:14,199 --> 01:28:16,202
What if I shoot you by mistake?

796
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,688
Wouldn't be the first time.

797
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:20,279
Pick it up.

798
01:28:20,359 --> 01:28:22,283
I said, I hate guns.

799
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:29,644
SIG 226.

800
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,570
Front sight. Rear sight. Hammer.

801
01:28:38,359 --> 01:28:40,600
You just point it.
You squeeze the trigger.

802
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:42,921
You try not to close your eyes.

803
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:46,244
Please, try it.

804
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:14,091
I don't have to
teach you anything, do I?

805
01:29:16,119 --> 01:29:19,203
A man once came to our house
to kill my father.

806
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:23,048
He didn't know I was upstairs
playing in my bedroom.

807
01:29:23,119 --> 01:29:25,407
Or that Papa kept
a Beretta Nine-millimeter

808
01:29:25,479 --> 01:29:27,641
under the sink with the bleach.

809
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,882
That's why I hate guns.

810
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:36,845
I think we'll skip
hand-to-hand combat.

811
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:55,881
Good evening, sir.

812
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:58,087
Sorry to interrupt your supper,
but we have some news.

813
01:29:58,159 --> 01:29:59,604
Evening, sir.

814
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:02,159
Using the Smart Blood,
I've tracked Bond

815
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:04,765
to a point here in North Africa.

816
01:30:06,039 --> 01:30:08,690
See, every known map
registers it as empty desert.

817
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:12,605
Exactly. But if you look at the satellite blowup,
you can clearly see this.

818
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,291
We can't help him.

819
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,125
But, sir, we know
where he's heading.

820
01:30:19,119 --> 01:30:21,009
C is watching everything we do.

821
01:30:21,079 --> 01:30:23,685
We're only handing them
more information.

822
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:29,287
Sir, we can't just desert Bond.

823
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:31,448
We have to.
We only make him weaker.

824
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,090
But, sir,
we know exactly where he is.

825
01:30:33,159 --> 01:30:35,810
Yes, I know, but if we can track him,
so can others.

826
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,926
Delete all
the Smart Blood files.

827
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,161
Everything.

828
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:43,684
He's on his own.

829
01:31:10,039 --> 01:31:11,371
You shouldn't stare.

830
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:13,363
Well, you shouldn't
look like that.

831
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:19,323
May I get you an <i>apéritif?</i>

832
01:31:19,399 --> 01:31:20,685
I'm not sure.

833
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:23,842
It gets me into trouble.
Makes me do crazy things.

834
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,489
Well, we can't have that.

835
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:29,367
So, I'll have
a vodka martini, dirty.

836
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:31,204
Make that two.

837
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,210
I have a question.

838
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,760
Well, what's that?

839
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:40,729
Why, given every
other possible option,

840
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:43,560
does a man choose the life
of a paid assassin?

841
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,608
Well, it was that
or the priesthood.

842
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,922
I'm serious.
Is this really what you want?

843
01:31:51,159 --> 01:31:54,845
Living in the shadows?
Hunting? Being hunted?

844
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:58,569
Always looking behind you?
Always alone?

845
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,206
But I'm not alone.

846
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,644
Answer the question.

847
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,239
I'm not sure I ever
had a choice.

848
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,681
Anyway, I don't stop
to think about it.

849
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,922
What would happen if you did?

850
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:15,166
Stop? Yes.

851
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:20,570
I don't know.

852
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:22,890
Your drinks, sir.

853
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,439
Could you leave
them there, please.

854
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:39,081
You know, I think you're wrong.

855
01:32:39,159 --> 01:32:40,524
I am?

856
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,768
We always have a choice.

857
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:48,208
I'll drink to that.

858
01:35:36,279 --> 01:35:37,280
Shit.

859
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:47,363
What do we do now?

860
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,564
This might be a long wait.

861
01:36:51,079 --> 01:36:53,367
Are you having second thoughts?

862
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:55,409
Too late now.

863
01:37:15,039 --> 01:37:16,404
What's that?

864
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:36,448
That is a 1948
Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith.

865
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:01,766
Please.

866
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,609
I'm scared, James.

867
01:39:10,439 --> 01:39:13,125
Good afternoon,
Mr. Bond, Dr. Swann.

868
01:39:13,399 --> 01:39:17,199
I want you to know just how excited
we all are to finally meet you.

869
01:39:17,279 --> 01:39:20,045
Well, it's a pleasure
to be here.

870
01:39:20,279 --> 01:39:22,760
Your host invites
you both to rest,

871
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:25,240
relax, and join him
for drinks at 4:00.

872
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:27,881
- Tell our host we won't be late.
- Wonderful.

873
01:39:28,199 --> 01:39:30,965
Before we show you to your rooms,
just one more thing.

874
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:39,881
Oh.

875
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:44,323
You be careful with that.

876
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:46,689
It's loaded.

877
01:39:53,239 --> 01:39:54,570
Thank you.

878
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,966
This is a very special place.

879
01:40:56,479 --> 01:40:59,801
He has requested
you enter it alone.

880
01:41:00,319 --> 01:41:01,650
Of course.

881
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:05,490
Champagne?

882
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:08,244
Maybe later.

883
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:10,284
Certainly.

884
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:44,251
I think
we're meant to be impressed.

885
01:41:57,159 --> 01:41:58,399
Touch it.

886
01:42:00,079 --> 01:42:02,287
You can touch it if you want.

887
01:42:04,479 --> 01:42:06,288
Do you know what it is?

888
01:42:06,359 --> 01:42:08,043
It's a meteorite.

889
01:42:09,159 --> 01:42:10,889
Yes, exactly.

890
01:42:11,359 --> 01:42:15,159
The Kartenhoff.
The oldest in human possession.

891
01:42:16,319 --> 01:42:19,163
The very meteorite
which made this crater.

892
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,239
Think about it.

893
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:26,520
So many years up there,
alone, silent,

894
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:31,604
building momentum until it chose
to make its mark on Earth.

895
01:42:33,399 --> 01:42:36,131
A huge, unstoppable force.

896
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:39,046
Except it did stop, didn't it?

897
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:40,930
Right here.

898
01:42:55,359 --> 01:42:59,206
I can't tell you how much I've been
looking forward to this.

899
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:01,600
All of us here, together.

900
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:05,925
A reunion.

901
01:43:08,079 --> 01:43:10,923
I'm so glad you came,
too, dear Madeleine.

902
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:15,564
You were just a girl
when I saw you first.

903
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:19,930
I came to your home once
to see your father.

904
01:43:22,439 --> 01:43:24,123
I don't remember that.

905
01:43:25,399 --> 01:43:26,810
But I do.

906
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:32,680
Shall we?

907
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:37,880
What is this place?

908
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:40,051
Information.

909
01:43:43,319 --> 01:43:45,048
Information is all,

910
01:43:46,359 --> 01:43:47,690
is it not?

911
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:50,364
For example,

912
01:43:50,439 --> 01:43:55,047
you must know by now that
the double-0 program is officially dead.

913
01:43:55,239 --> 01:43:59,484
Which leads me to
speculate exactly why you came.

914
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:05,649
So, James, why did you come?

915
01:44:06,159 --> 01:44:07,844
I came here to kill you.

916
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:11,161
And I thought you
came here to die.

917
01:44:11,479 --> 01:44:13,528
Well, it's all
a matter of perspective.

918
01:44:15,159 --> 01:44:17,048
Speaking of perspective.

919
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:38,207
- Is this live?
- Live and direct. 16:20 GMT.

920
01:44:39,479 --> 01:44:41,720
What an uncanny coincidence.

921
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:46,283
<i>The French have a saying,
"It's the fate of glass to break."</i>

922
01:44:46,359 --> 01:44:50,444
<i>Well, maybe it's the fate of spies
to just disappear.</i>

923
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:52,363
<i>But with any luck,</i>

924
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:54,768
<i>we leave something behind.</i>

925
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,527
<i>In the meantime,
I'm sure C will keep you all busy.</i>

926
01:44:59,239 --> 01:45:00,890
<i>Thank you all.</i>

927
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:07,524
That's touching,
don't you think?

928
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:12,363
Well, James,

929
01:45:13,039 --> 01:45:15,327
it looks like you're all alone.

930
01:45:15,399 --> 01:45:18,051
Not much more than a voyeur,
are you?

931
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:21,082
Too scared to join in.

932
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:23,003
I don't think you quite understand.

933
01:45:23,079 --> 01:45:24,490
Oh, I think I do.

934
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:27,324
You set cities on fire and watch
innocent people burn,

935
01:45:27,399 --> 01:45:29,606
so you can convince
governments to join

936
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:32,331
an intelligence network
you've paid for.

937
01:45:32,399 --> 01:45:34,243
Not that complicated.

938
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:38,760
I'm guessing our little friend, C,
he's one of your disciples.

939
01:45:40,199 --> 01:45:41,929
You could say that.

940
01:45:42,119 --> 01:45:43,724
And what does he get out of it?

941
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:45,926
Nothing.

942
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:48,368
He's a visionary, like me.

943
01:45:48,439 --> 01:45:50,090
Visionaries.

944
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:52,769
Psychiatric wards
are full of them.

945
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:55,804
Whereas you couldn't see
what's right in front of you.

946
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:59,885
You came across me so many times
and yet you never saw me.

947
01:46:00,439 --> 01:46:02,841
Le Chiffre, Greene, Silva.

948
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:04,086
All dead.

949
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:05,286
Yeah, that's right.

950
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:07,050
A nice pattern developed.

951
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:10,567
You interfered in my world,
I destroyed yours.

952
01:46:12,439 --> 01:46:14,043
Or did you think
it was coincidence

953
01:46:14,119 --> 01:46:16,690
that all the women in
your life ended up dead?

954
01:46:18,119 --> 01:46:20,202
Vesper Lynd, for example.

955
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:25,082
She was the big one.
Has he told you about her?

956
01:46:27,439 --> 01:46:30,603
And then, of course,
your beloved M.

957
01:46:31,479 --> 01:46:33,481
Gone forever.

958
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:38,761
Me.

959
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:42,721
It was all me, James.

960
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:46,600
It's always been me.
The author of all your pain.

961
01:46:50,439 --> 01:46:52,841
You're a brave woman, my dear.

962
01:47:00,159 --> 01:47:03,323
Now I understand why
my father lost his mind.

963
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:06,569
He didn't lose his mind,
he was just weak.

964
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:08,641
But at least he understood
what he was up against.

965
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:12,208
You see, they failed
to comprehend the crucial fact,

966
01:47:12,319 --> 01:47:16,006
that a terrible event
can lead to something wonderful.

967
01:47:18,359 --> 01:47:20,362
Since you mention your father,
I'll show you.

968
01:47:21,359 --> 01:47:23,886
<i>She's clever. She's smarter than me.</i>

969
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:25,199
<i>She knows how to hide.</i>

970
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:30,444
<i>I can protect her
if you tell me where he is.</i>

971
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:34,489
<i>I can keep her alive.</i>

972
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:35,800
<i>Yeah.</i>

973
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:37,086
<i>You have my word.</i>

974
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:39,127
No, no, no. Turn this off.

975
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:40,804
<i>Your word?</i>

976
01:47:41,359 --> 01:47:42,805
<i>The word of an assassin!</i>

977
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,211
Turn this off.

978
01:47:44,359 --> 01:47:46,362
This is important.
I said turn it off!

979
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,525
I want you to
understand something.

980
01:48:01,399 --> 01:48:03,083
<i>That's my word.</i>

981
01:48:04,359 --> 01:48:05,485
Madeleine?

982
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,411
Look at me.

983
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:12,006
Don't look at him,
Madeleine. Look at me.

984
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:15,369
<i>L'Américain.</i>

985
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:18,130
<i>You save her,</i>

986
01:48:18,479 --> 01:48:21,563
<i>she can lead you to L'Américain.
She knows L'Américain.</i>

987
01:48:24,359 --> 01:48:26,408
<i>Try the Hoffler Klinik.</i>

988
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:37,288
<i>You're a kite dancing in a hurricane,
Mr. Bond.</i>

989
01:48:40,439 --> 01:48:41,770
<i>So long.</i>

990
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:52,287
The things that
bring people together.

991
01:48:56,239 --> 01:48:58,890
Out of horror, beauty.

992
01:49:25,439 --> 01:49:28,250
Torture is easy,
on a superficial level.

993
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:31,448
A man can watch himself
being disemboweled

994
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:35,122
and derive great horror
from the experience,

995
01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:37,850
but it's still
going on at a distance.

996
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,765
It isn't taking
place where he is.

997
01:49:41,479 --> 01:49:47,168
As you know all too well, dear Madeleine,
a man lives inside his head.

998
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:50,404
That's where
the seat of his soul is.

999
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:54,206
Now, James and I were
both present recently

1000
01:49:54,279 --> 01:49:56,805
when a man was
deprived of his eyes.

1001
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:01,087
And the most
astonishing thing happened.

1002
01:50:01,159 --> 01:50:02,320
Didn't you notice?

1003
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:05,002
He wasn't there anymore.

1004
01:50:05,359 --> 01:50:07,726
He'd gone even though
he was still alive.

1005
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:11,690
So in this brief moment
between life and death,

1006
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:14,604
there was nobody
inside his skull.

1007
01:50:16,159 --> 01:50:17,490
Most odd.

1008
01:50:19,399 --> 01:50:20,810
So, James.

1009
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:25,529
I'm going to penetrate

1010
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:28,720
to where you are.

1011
01:50:29,479 --> 01:50:31,720
To the inside of your head.

1012
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:35,564
Now, the first probe
will play with your sight,

1013
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,046
your hearing

1014
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:39,807
and your balance,

1015
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:42,724
just with the subtlest
of manipulations.

1016
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:44,927
Well, get on with it then.

1017
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:48,881
Nothing can be as painful
as listening to you talk.

1018
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:51,045
All right.

1019
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:53,244
Let's begin.

1020
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:27,881
Why are you doing this?

1021
01:51:41,079 --> 01:51:43,207
You probably know
that James here

1022
01:51:43,279 --> 01:51:45,408
lost his parents
when he was young.

1023
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:51,206
But did you know
that it was my father

1024
01:51:51,279 --> 01:51:53,680
who helped him
through this difficult time?

1025
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,841
Over the course of two winters

1026
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:08,130
he taught him to ski,
and climb, and hunt.

1027
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:13,323
He soothed the wounds
of the poor little blue-eyed orphan.

1028
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:18,645
Asked me to treat
him as a brother.

1029
01:52:19,159 --> 01:52:20,923
My little brother.

1030
01:52:22,479 --> 01:52:24,481
They formed quite an attachment.

1031
01:52:26,159 --> 01:52:27,286
So,

1032
01:52:28,119 --> 01:52:29,326
you killed him.

1033
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:32,329
Yes, I did.

1034
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,524
You know what happens
when a cuckoo

1035
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:41,524
hatches inside
another bird's nest?

1036
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:43,961
Yes.

1037
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,445
It forces the other eggs out.

1038
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:48,567
Yes.

1039
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:53,845
Well, this cuckoo made me realize
my father's life had to end.

1040
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:57,770
In a way, he's responsible
for the path I took.

1041
01:52:58,039 --> 01:53:00,690
- So, thank you.
- Cuckoo.

1042
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:09,444
Do you know any other
birdcalls, Franz?

1043
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,331
Hello, pussy.

1044
01:53:21,039 --> 01:53:24,646
Franz Oberhauser died
20 years ago, James.

1045
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:27,484
In an avalanche,
alongside his father.

1046
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:33,168
The man you are talking to now,
the man inside your head,

1047
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:36,485
is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

1048
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,369
Catchy name.

1049
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,881
My mother's bloodline.

1050
01:53:42,359 --> 01:53:46,569
If the needle finds the correct spot
in the fusiform gyrus,

1051
01:53:47,079 --> 01:53:49,082
you'll recognize no one.

1052
01:53:49,319 --> 01:53:50,970
Of course,
the faces of your women

1053
01:53:51,039 --> 01:53:52,929
are interchangeable,
aren't they, James?

1054
01:53:55,079 --> 01:53:56,684
You won't know who she is.

1055
01:53:56,760 --> 01:54:00,002
Just another passing face
on your way to the grave.

1056
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:11,451
He dies not knowing who you are.

1057
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:15,609
The daughter of an assassin.

1058
01:54:16,239 --> 01:54:18,242
The only one
who could have understood him.

1059
01:54:19,399 --> 01:54:20,765
Shame.

1060
01:54:57,680 --> 01:54:59,170
I love you.

1061
01:55:04,439 --> 01:55:06,920
Do those blue eyes
still recognize you?

1062
01:55:11,319 --> 01:55:14,130
I'd recognize you anywhere.

1063
01:55:16,359 --> 01:55:17,725
The watch.

1064
01:55:33,159 --> 01:55:34,570
One minute.

1065
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,489
One minute.

1066
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:43,283
Did he say something?

1067
01:55:43,359 --> 01:55:44,690
<i>Tempus fugit.</i>

1068
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:49,204
- What?
<i>- Tempus fugit.</i>

1069
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:51,681
I can't hear you, James.

1070
01:55:54,079 --> 01:55:55,411
I said,

1071
01:55:56,199 --> 01:55:58,042
doesn't time fly?

1072
01:56:25,359 --> 01:56:26,690
In there!

1073
01:57:08,279 --> 01:57:09,770
Let's go home.

1074
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:27,644
It's not over yet.

1075
01:58:17,479 --> 01:58:19,050
I've never even
heard of Hildebrand.

1076
01:58:19,119 --> 01:58:22,363
That is the general
idea with safe houses.

1077
01:58:39,319 --> 01:58:40,970
Exactly how safe is this, sir?

1078
01:58:41,039 --> 01:58:42,882
We're about to find out.

1079
01:58:46,319 --> 01:58:47,810
It's safe.

1080
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:49,529
Better wait here.

1081
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:54,126
I'm M.

1082
01:58:54,199 --> 01:58:55,247
Madeleine Swann.

1083
01:58:55,319 --> 01:58:56,319
Pleased to meet you.

1084
01:58:56,359 --> 01:58:58,203
So, what do you
have for me, 007?

1085
01:58:58,279 --> 01:59:02,364
The recently deceased head of Spectre,
Ernst Stavro Blofeld,

1086
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:06,845
and his chief of intelligence,
your new best friend, C.

1087
01:59:08,239 --> 01:59:11,243
About to take control of his
very own global surveillance system

1088
01:59:11,319 --> 01:59:13,800
that he built right
here under our noses.

1089
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:16,326
Then we'd better move.
The system goes online at midnight.

1090
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:19,609
If that happens,
Spectre will have control of everything.

1091
01:59:19,680 --> 01:59:21,648
So, you and I will
have a quiet word with C

1092
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:24,404
while Q hacks into the system
and stops it going online.

1093
01:59:25,039 --> 01:59:26,041
It won't be easy.

1094
01:59:26,119 --> 01:59:28,520
He'll find a way.
He always does.

1095
01:59:33,319 --> 01:59:35,208
It's good to have you back, 007.

1096
01:59:36,079 --> 01:59:37,161
Sir.

1097
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:48,603
James, I can't.

1098
01:59:49,359 --> 01:59:52,283
I'll come back for you
when it's all over.

1099
01:59:53,279 --> 01:59:54,850
No, I can't.

1100
01:59:55,279 --> 01:59:57,282
No, you can't
stay here, or you...

1101
01:59:57,960 --> 02:00:02,170
I can't go back to this life.
And I'm not going to ask you to change.

1102
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:04,369
This is who you are.

1103
02:00:07,119 --> 02:00:08,689
You're saying good-bye.

1104
02:00:09,439 --> 02:00:10,565
Yes.

1105
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:14,091
Take care.

1106
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:18,521
You're a good man, James.

1107
02:01:19,680 --> 02:01:21,250
Are you in yet, Q?

1108
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:24,001
A few layers of impenetrable
security still to go,

1109
02:01:24,079 --> 02:01:26,047
<i>but I think
I'm getting somewhere.</i>

1110
02:02:14,479 --> 02:02:16,050
They've seen us! Reverse!

1111
02:02:55,960 --> 02:02:57,121
Go!

1112
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:10,127
Get him in the building!

1113
02:03:10,239 --> 02:03:12,447
Move. Move!

1114
02:04:31,399 --> 02:04:34,926
Go back and find M, now!
We need them both.

1115
02:04:44,399 --> 02:04:47,243
Not a good feeling
being watched, is it?

1116
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:53,842
Don't tell me you're
responsible for this.

1117
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:56,810
No, but my Quartermaster is.

1118
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:58,609
And he's extremely talented.

1119
02:04:58,720 --> 02:04:59,766
Well, bravo.

1120
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:04,243
But in case you hadn't realized it,
you two are out of a job.

1121
02:05:04,319 --> 02:05:05,560
So you're trespassing.

1122
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:08,086
I'm afraid you've got
the wrong end of the stick, Max.

1123
02:05:08,159 --> 02:05:10,925
We're going to
stop this system going online.

1124
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,411
And then I'm going
to bring you in.

1125
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:14,045
On what grounds exactly?

1126
02:05:14,359 --> 02:05:16,248
Poor taste in friends.

1127
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:55,001
Take a look at the world.

1128
02:05:56,600 --> 02:05:57,761
Chaos.

1129
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:00,802
Because people like you,

1130
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:02,324
paper-pushers and politicians,

1131
02:06:02,439 --> 02:06:05,966
are too spineless to do
what needs to be done.

1132
02:06:06,439 --> 02:06:09,886
So I made an alliance to put
the power where it should be.

1133
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:15,000
And now you want to throw
it away for the sake of "democracy."

1134
02:06:15,600 --> 02:06:17,283
Whatever the hell that is.

1135
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:20,411
How predictably moronic.

1136
02:06:20,479 --> 02:06:23,847
But then isn't that
what M stands for?

1137
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:27,648
"Moron."

1138
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:31,041
And now we know
what C stands for.

1139
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:37,011
"Careless."

1140
02:07:16,279 --> 02:07:17,930
Come on.

1141
02:07:18,039 --> 02:07:19,804
No, no, no!

1142
02:08:24,079 --> 02:08:27,368
You're a hard man
to kill, Blofeld.

1143
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:35,962
Ouch.

1144
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:38,288
I do hope that
doesn't hurt too much.

1145
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:43,046
My wounds will heal.

1146
02:08:43,119 --> 02:08:44,770
What about yours?

1147
02:08:46,319 --> 02:08:48,640
Look around you, James. Look.

1148
02:08:49,079 --> 02:08:51,287
This is what's
left of your world.

1149
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:55,770
Everything you ever stood for,
everything you believed in, a ruin.

1150
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:59,445
Why are we here?

1151
02:09:00,680 --> 02:09:02,444
Did you miss me?

1152
02:09:03,319 --> 02:09:04,605
No.

1153
02:09:11,239 --> 02:09:14,323
But I know someone who does.

1154
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:23,601
Where is she?

1155
02:09:24,399 --> 02:09:26,845
That's for you to find out.

1156
02:09:34,359 --> 02:09:37,363
In three minutes,
this building will be demolished.

1157
02:09:38,439 --> 02:09:40,680
I can get out easily.

1158
02:09:40,760 --> 02:09:42,807
Now, you have a choice.

1159
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:45,445
Die trying to save her or

1160
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:47,921
save yourself and
live with the pain.

1161
02:09:49,079 --> 02:09:50,206
You're bluffing.

1162
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:53,881
Am I?

1163
02:10:01,560 --> 02:10:03,680
I've really put you through it,
haven't I?

1164
02:10:05,159 --> 02:10:06,729
That's brothers for you.

1165
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:11,167
They always know
which buttons to press.

1166
02:10:23,560 --> 02:10:25,608
Madeleine!

1167
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:32,609
Come on.

1168
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,001
Come on.

1169
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:37,010
Yes!

1170
02:10:38,640 --> 02:10:40,005
Let's go.

1171
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:41,720
After you.

1172
02:10:52,119 --> 02:10:55,408
Why can't you just face it, M?

1173
02:10:56,479 --> 02:10:57,925
You don't matter anymore.

1174
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:00,841
Maybe I don't.

1175
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:02,126
But something has to.

1176
02:11:57,079 --> 02:11:58,081
Dead.

1177
02:11:58,279 --> 02:11:59,690
- Any word on Bond?
- No.

1178
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:01,682
But I can hazard a guess.

1179
02:12:09,439 --> 02:12:11,521
Madeleine!

1180
02:12:13,720 --> 02:12:15,768
Madeleine!

1181
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:01,685
Do you trust me?

1182
02:13:02,039 --> 02:13:03,166
Do I have a choice?

1183
02:13:03,239 --> 02:13:04,240
Not anymore.

1184
02:13:15,079 --> 02:13:16,411
Come on!

1185
02:13:31,439 --> 02:13:33,328
Good-bye, James Bond.

1186
02:15:36,039 --> 02:15:37,609
Brace, brace, brace!

1187
02:16:45,440 --> 02:16:46,680
Sir, this is a terrorist alert.

1188
02:16:46,799 --> 02:16:47,960
Mallory, double-0 section.

1189
02:16:51,239 --> 02:16:53,208
Stand them down.

1190
02:16:54,639 --> 02:16:56,129
Echo team, hold fire.

1191
02:16:56,440 --> 02:16:58,727
Stand down.

1192
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:35,325
Finish it.

1193
02:17:46,879 --> 02:17:48,609
Finish it.

1194
02:18:01,159 --> 02:18:02,604
Out of bullets.

1195
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:21,567
And besides,

1196
02:18:21,879 --> 02:18:23,881
I've got something better to do.

1197
02:19:10,360 --> 02:19:12,522
Under the Special
Measures Act of 2001,

1198
02:19:12,600 --> 02:19:15,523
I am detaining you on behalf of
Her Majesty's Government.

1199
02:20:21,639 --> 02:20:22,925
Bond?

1200
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,002
What are you doing here?
Good morning, Q.

1201
02:20:37,879 --> 02:20:39,085
I thought you'd gone.

1202
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:40,325
I have.

1203
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:44,441
There's just one thing I need.

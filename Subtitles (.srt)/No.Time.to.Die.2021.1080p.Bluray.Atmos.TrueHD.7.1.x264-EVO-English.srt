1
00:00:58,017 --> 00:00:59,435
Madeleine?

2
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:10,696
Madeleine!

3
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:16,619
Madeleine!

4
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:54,073
Non.

5
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:29,233
Maman.

6
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:30,318
Maman.

7
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,236
Maman. Maman.

8
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,365
Maman!

9
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,683
Maman!

10
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,342
Is Mr. White home?

11
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,220
No. He's gone.

12
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:42,681
My name is Lyutsifer Safin.

13
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,226
-Your husband killed my family.

14
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,478
I told you, he's gone.

15
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:51,399
I know. This will hurt him more.

16
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:14,602
You okay?

17
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,063
Yes.

18
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:21,358
Let's go.

19
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,082
How's the view?

20
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,210
It's growing on me.

21
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:44,590
Can you go faster?

22
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,760
We don't need to go faster.

23
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,138
We have all the time in the world.

24
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,338
- Buonasera, signore.
-Buonasera.

25
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:36,308
You can't help
looking over your shoulder.

26
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:39,186
-What?
-No one is coming.

27
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,231
-I wasn't looking over my shoulder.
-Yes, you were.

28
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,274
No. Are we going to
have a row about this?

29
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,777
What are they burning?

30
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,280
Secrets. Wishes.
Letting go of the past.

31
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,075
Getting rid of old things,
in come the new.

32
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,466
Je taime.

33
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,760
Je taime.

34
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,152
Where did you go to?

35
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,030
Today, by the water. Hmm?

36
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,198
Tell me.

37
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,036
I'll tell you
if you tell me about Vesper.

38
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:42,958
Is that why we're here?

39
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,128
-She's buried at the acropolis.
-I know where she's buried.

40
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:51,341
Can you forgive her? For us?

41
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,804
I left her behind a long time ago.

42
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:05,439
As long as we're looking over
our shoulder, the past is not dead.

43
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,156
You have to let her go,
even if it's hard.

44
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,951
You mean, um,
if we're to have a future?

45
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,286
Mm-hmm.

46
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:23,499
So, I do this, and then...

47
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,084
I'll tell you all my secrets.

48
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,005
Okay.

49
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,077
I'm going to go and do this,

50
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,246
and then I'm going to come back
for breakfast.

51
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:47,666
Thank you.

52
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,421
And then you're going to tell me
where we're going next.

53
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,009
Home.

54
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,113
Buongiorno.

55
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,665
I miss you.

56
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,282
Madeleine?

57
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,826
Madeleine?

58
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,816
Blofeld sends his regards.

59
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,569
You know...

60
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:29,030
Madeleine,
she is a daughter of Spectre.

61
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:33,410
She's a daughter of Spectre.

62
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,915
Your baggage is already down,
Mr. Bond.

63
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,750
As your wife requested.

64
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,091
You were right.

65
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:34,221
Letting go is hard.

66
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,348
James.

67
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:37,807
What happened?

68
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,977
What happened?

69
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,520
How did they know I was here?

70
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:45,815
-What are you talking about?
-Madeleine, how did they know I was here?

71
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,193
-I have no idea what you're--
-Spectre. How did they know?

72
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,695
What are you talking about?
James!

73
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,491
I didn't do anything.

74
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,702
-I didn't do anything.

75
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,918
We're leaving.

76
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,601
There is something
I need to tell you.

77
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,436
I bet there is.

78
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,318
James!

79
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,550
Pick it up. Pick it up!

80
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,647
It's Blofeld, my love.

81
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:10,358
Your father would be so proud of you.

82
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,153
Your sacrifice will be our glory.

83
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,487
-I don't understand.
-Bravo.

84
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:31,880
James, why?
Why would I betray you?

85
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,674
We all have our secrets.

86
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,760
We just didn't get to yours yet.

87
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,876
James. James, listen to me.

88
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,336
I'd rather die
than you think I'm tr--

89
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,189
James!

90
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,025
James!

91
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,402
Do something. James!

92
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,531
Say something, James!

93
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:24,742
Please.

94
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,337
Okay.

95
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:33,978
Come on.

96
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,285
So...

97
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:52,830
this is it?

98
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,208
This is it.

99
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,927
How will I know that you're okay?

100
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,429
You won't.

101
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,099
You'll never see me again.

102
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,837
We're in.

103
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,630
- Proceed.

104
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,802
Please remember to back up
all data by 10:00 p.m. this evening

105
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,595
aue to planned server maintenance.

106
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,808
You okay?

107
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:07,854
You know the SL5, the weaponized smallpox
I was using this morning?

108
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:10,940
Have you seen it?
I-I put it in the bloody--

109
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:14,151
Valdo, you haven't seen
a tub of smallpox, have you?

110
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:20,283
This was a good soup,
now it is waste,

111
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,159
even if it is joke.

112
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:23,536
-Idiot.

113
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,330
There is more complexity
in my tomato soup

114
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:28,708
than in both of your brains combined.

115
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:31,627
Valdo, that is so unkind. It's so--

116
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:34,255
One day I will put Ebola
in your tea.

117
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:38,092
And then I will watch
as your faces sweat blood,

118
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,969
-and I will be laughing.

119
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,054
-Nice. Keep your hair on.
-Wow.

120
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,807
He's got a terrifying imagination,
hasn't he?

121
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:45,933
Dr. Obruchev.

122
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:47,935
They are coming.

123
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:49,020
Who?

124
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:50,271
Spectre.

125
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,110
Safin.

126
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:57,737
Do not try to stop them.

127
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,864
This is what
we ve been waiting for.

128
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:07,914
They will ask you to enter Bio Security
Level-4 fridge and remove the weapon.

129
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:10,082
No one must see what you are doing.

130
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:14,128
They will not kill you.
They think they need you.

131
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:16,297
They will not kill me?

132
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,676
Transferring the files
as we speak.

133
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:24,931
Now... Now it's done.
What do I do with it?

134
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:26,599
-Swallow it. Goodbye.

135
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:27,683
Swallow the--

136
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:32,396
Yes, I like animals!

137
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,481
Bye-bye.

138
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:37,985
For goodness' sake!

139
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:48,704
Danger. Illegal access defected.

140
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:51,415
Secure all biohazardous materials
immediately.

141
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,337
- Move! Follow!

142
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:00,091
No! No!

143
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,553
Caution. Unauthorized
personnel located in this sector.

144
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,273
Please, we're scientists.
We're unarmed.

145
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:18,943
-We're unarmed. What do you want?

146
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,279
Valdo Obruchev.

147
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:24,198
Uh-huh. Hello.

148
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:26,993
Open the Bio Security Level-4 fridge.

149
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:30,579
-And...
-Give me the weapon.

150
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,373
What weapon?

151
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:33,916
We have--

152
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:36,377
Heracles.

153
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,171
-It requires double authentication.
-Which one?

154
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,050
Him.

155
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,636
Hardy. Hardy! Don't let them.

156
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,014
Don't let them.
Don't let them, please.

157
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,223
- No!

158
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:37,563
Warning, facility lockdown in progress.

159
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:41,150
All exits are now sealed.

160
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,737
Warning, facility lockdown in progress.

161
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,823
All exits are now sealed.

162
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:51,243
Oh, what is--

163
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:53,537
-It's a safety belt? This?

164
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,250
Wow.

165
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:15,476
I-l cannot.

166
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:18,312
There is no elevator!

167
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,361
Magnets.

168
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:46,715
Sir, I've just received
the most unusual--

169
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,551
-I've seen it.

170
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:56,517
Oh, Jesus Christ.

171
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:04,316
Sir, what's the Heracles project?

172
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,111
This lab isn't on the books.

173
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,362
No, it's not.

174
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:13,075
-There were casualties.
-It was a gas leak.

175
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:14,994
Shall I alert the PM?

176
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:16,829
It was a gas leak. I'll handle it.

177
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:17,997
Moneypenny.

178
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:21,792
Where's 0077?

179
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,900
Well, isn't this a surprise, Felix?

180
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:52,818
James.

181
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:54,903
Who's the blond?

182
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:59,033
Logan Ash, State Department.
It's really nice to meet you.

183
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:03,287
I've heard a lot about you.
I mean, I'm a huge fan.

184
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,830
-Babylon.
-Police boy.

185
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,040
I need a favor, brother.

186
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:08,000
You didn't get the memo?
I'm retired.

187
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:11,045
I wouldn't ask if you were still
in Her Majesty's Service.

188
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,296
And what does that mean?

189
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:16,967
Our elected leaders aren't playing nice
in the sandbox.

190
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,219
James.

191
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:24,308
Is there somewhere quiet
where we can talk in private?

192
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:27,811
Quiet? Yeah.

193
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,566
I was hoping
you could pick up a package.

194
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:33,567
- Five.
- Four.

195
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:37,363
Where's the package?

196
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,281
Short trip. Cuba.

197
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:41,075
You love it there.

198
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:42,993
Oh, I love it there?

199
00:36:43,077 --> 00:36:44,286
Valdo Obrucheuv.

200
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,246
You're gonna say
you never heard of him.

201
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,956
Never heard of him.

202
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,500
-Two.
-Three.

203
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:51,251
Ah.

204
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:52,544
It's a good life.

205
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:57,132
You never heard of him? Didn't he defect
during your tenure at MI6?

206
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,761
Obruchev was kidnapped three days ago
from a secret MI6 lab in London.

207
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:04,223
Two days ago, his mug pinged
on a facial-recognition sweep

208
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,350
in Santiago de Cuba.

209
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,268
He's leaving out the best part.

210
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:09,770
Spectre.

211
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:12,981
I have a contact there,
says they're gathering.

212
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:15,150
Coincidence?

213
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:20,155
Come on. It'll be like old times.

214
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:22,533
-Three.
-Two.

215
00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:28,622
You're really
the only guy for the job.

216
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,041
You're the guy.

217
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:32,793
It's my round.

218
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:42,344
Hi.

219
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:48,517
-Scotch.
-Yeah, man.

220
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:54,189
Where'd you find
the Book of Mormon?

221
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:56,984
Political appointee.
Not my choice.

222
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:59,528
Seems intelligence
isn't central anymore.

223
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:01,864
He smiles too much.

224
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,241
Help us get this
into the right hands.

225
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,743
-What, and you're the right hands?
-I'm not just a pretty face.

226
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:09,663
I stopped trusting pretty faces
a long time ago, Felix.

227
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,874
Yeah, I heard. Bad luck.

228
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,709
-Bad judgment.
-Yeah.

229
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:18,547
Harder to tell the good from bad,
villains from heroes these days.

230
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,966
I need you, James.

231
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,510
You're the only one I trust with this.
I'm not screwing around.

232
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:26,513
I wanna get back to my family,
tell them I saved the world again.

233
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:28,849
Don't you?

234
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,604
Nice to see you again, Felix.

235
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:37,566
-At least take my number.
-I've got your number.

236
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,552
In trouble?

237
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,181
Constantly.

238
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:10,724
Need a ride?

239
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,727
Sure. Why not?

240
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:18,440
Hold on.

241
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:23,529
-What's your name?
-Nomi.

242
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:26,073
-Yours?
-James. Call me James.

243
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,534
-What do you do, Nomi?
-I'm a diver.

244
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,160
What do you dive for?

245
00:39:30,244 --> 00:39:32,829
-I have a thing for old wrecks.

246
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:34,540
Well, then you've come
to the right place.

247
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,507
After you.

248
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:56,353
Hmm.

249
00:39:57,271 --> 00:39:58,647
Nice house.

250
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,856
Thank you.

251
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:01,942
Is that the bedroom?

252
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:07,614
Yes, itis.

253
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,760
Well, that's not the first thing
I thought you'd take off, but...

254
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:29,845
Yeah.

255
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:34,600
You seem like a man
who's gagging for some action, Mr. Bond.

256
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:37,603
Shall we cut to the chase?

257
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:40,981
-I'm here as a professional courtesy.
-Well, you're not very courteous, are you?

258
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,733
You've broken my car--

259
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:45,235
It's Commander Bond,
but you know that.

260
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:48,071
Double-07?

261
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:49,573
-Two years.
-Very young.

262
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:52,242
-High achiever.
-Oh, Jesus Christ.

263
00:40:52,326 --> 00:40:55,037
The world's moved on since you retired,
Commander Bond.

264
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,372
-Perhaps you didn't notice.
-No, can't say I had.

265
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:01,460
And in my humble opinion,
the world doesn't change very much.

266
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:03,545
You would say that.

267
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:07,174
Look, this all seems like heaven,
this little bubble or whatever.

268
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:11,303
But it's so obvious
you're a man who only has time to Kill,

269
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:12,638
nothing to live for.

270
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:15,474
So, Valdo Obruchev is off-limits.

271
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:18,894
You get in my way,
I will put a bullet in your knee.

272
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,022
The one that works.

273
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:26,902
You need to ask yourself
a few more questions.

274
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:33,659
MI6, CIA chasing after the same man,
not communicating with each other,

275
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:36,203
that's not good.

276
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:38,246
-Mmm.
-You know what?

277
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,292
Tell M hello, but...
I don't work for him anymore.

278
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,586
Tell him yourself.

279
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:49,383
By the way,

280
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:51,510
I'm not just any old double-0.

281
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:54,054
I'm 007.

282
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:58,517
You probably thought
they'd retire it.

283
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,729
It's just a number.

284
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:04,898
Yeah.

285
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:07,776
See you in Cuba?

286
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:11,697
How's it going, Q?

287
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,367
Several large files seem to have been
wiped from Obruchev's hard drive.

288
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,161
He was working on
some pretty advanced algorithm--

289
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:19,830
Can you retrieve the files?

290
00:42:19,913 --> 00:42:20,956
-Trying.

291
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,041
Get me everything you can
and then destroy the drive.

292
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,876
If I knew more about
what this was, I could--

293
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,337
-Thank you, Q. That's all.

294
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:29,423
Yes. One minute.
The PM is calling again.

295
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:31,633
007. Tell them something.
Anything.

296
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:35,345
007.

297
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:37,597
M, darling. Couple of things.

298
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:41,893
-Bond.
-I met your new 007.

299
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:44,104
She's a disarming young woman.

300
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,940
So, Obruchev.

301
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,900
You kept him on the payroll, didn't you?

302
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:51,653
Stay out of it.
This has nothing to do with you.

303
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:54,030
It does. It's Spectre.

304
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:55,949
Mallory...

305
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:58,076
what have you done?

306
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:10,630
-Double-0 trouble?
-The CIA have the advantage.

307
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:11,840
Get me Blofeld.

308
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,717
Sir, he only speaks
to his psychiatrist.

309
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,510
I know.
The live feed's what I want.

310
00:43:21,725 --> 00:43:25,729
They stay straight in the middle.
And then they bring him up.

311
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:28,523
He's like this every day,
mad as a bag of bees.

312
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:30,275
-It's crowning day.
-Good.

313
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:32,277
What is it?

314
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:34,362
It's nothing.

315
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:36,490
It's clean. It's clean as can be.

316
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:39,534
Everyone just wants a party.
Yeah, I want them both fo hear me.

317
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:42,871
It! be a surprise.

318
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:09,689
Felix...

319
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:10,816
I'm in.

320
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:12,651
He's in.

321
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:15,195
There's a young lady in Santiago
I want you to meet.

322
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:05,370
Paloma?

323
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:09,583
-You're late.
-l...

324
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:10,709
Vamos.

325
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:14,129
Um, something about a hat?
Paris, uh...

326
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:16,298
Huh? What hat?

327
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:20,719
I forget things
when I get nervous.

328
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:23,847
This is the biggest job
I've ever had. Come.

329
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:37,986
This your room?

330
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:40,113
It's a wine cellar.

331
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:43,658
Okay, come here.

332
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:51,207
Don't you think we ought to get to know
each other just a little bit before we--

333
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:52,500
Oh!

334
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:53,919
No, no, no, no.

335
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:56,379
Um, no, I'm sorry.

336
00:45:58,590 --> 00:45:59,716
-All right.
-You do it.

337
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:00,800
Thank you.

338
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:05,931
Do you mind?

339
00:46:10,936 --> 00:46:12,270
This is going to go brilliantly.

340
00:46:13,063 --> 00:46:15,690
I know.
I've done three weeks' training.

341
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:40,340
-c Que?
-Let's get a drink.

342
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:42,592
Good idea.

343
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:50,016
Two vodka martinis,
shaken, not stirred.

344
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,726
SJ, serior.

345
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:04,364
-So I can hear you.

346
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:12,706
What shall we drink to?

347
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:14,749
Felix?

348
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:16,543
To Felix.

349
00:47:18,128 --> 00:47:19,629
Remind me to get him a cigar.

350
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:31,141
¢ Vamos?

351
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:32,517
-Sure.
-Okay.

352
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:43,486
Will this sample
be enough for you?

353
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,864
If he has used it, yes.

354
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:47,615
It is now progressing.

355
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,541
Oops. Sorry.

356
00:47:57,417 --> 00:48:01,087
Terrible, terrible gloves.
So slippery.

357
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:02,797
Forgive me.

358
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:04,716
How much longer?

359
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:10,597
Aha!

360
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:14,851
To happy new future for Spectre.

361
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:19,647
Now it is ready.

362
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:52,555
You go that way.
I'll go this way.

363
00:49:00,105 --> 00:49:03,191
What is this?
Spectre bunga bunga?

364
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:06,194
You ever been to a party like this?

365
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,738
How do you think
I got this job?

366
00:49:08,822 --> 00:49:10,198
Don't get distracted, now.

367
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:12,575
Remember, we're looking
for our Russian scientist.

368
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:14,577
I'm seeing a lot of Spectre agents.

369
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:15,745
Yes.

370
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,164
And it looks like all of them.

371
00:49:22,502 --> 00:49:23,545
Wow.

372
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:35,765
Friend of yours?

373
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:37,100
Cyclops.

374
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:39,060
We ran into each other in Italy.

375
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:41,813
That was an eye-opening experience.

376
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:46,067
They're wearing earpieces.

377
00:49:46,568 --> 00:49:47,610
Scanning.

378
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:57,120
It'll be all clear.
It'll be clean.

379
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:59,122
It's good. It's as good as can be.

380
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,999
-It's my party.
-Ah. Found it.

381
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:04,460
Celebrate me, my birthaay,
my crowning day.

382
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:08,423
Who's the birthday boy?

383
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:11,384
Um, Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

384
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,136
Is he here?

385
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,888
-No, he's--
- Make your way.

386
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,181
Follow the music.

387
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:17,765
He's in London in prison.

388
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:19,851
How do you know for sure?

389
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:22,520
Because I put him there.

390
00:50:22,604 --> 00:50:24,939
Feel my warm embrace.

391
00:50:25,023 --> 00:50:28,026
Experience a delicious surprise.

392
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:32,906
Let us shepherd humanity
with our new power.

393
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:36,159
I've spotted him,
our little Russian scientist.

394
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:38,161
Have you got him?

395
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:40,205
-I got him.
- Stay with him.

396
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:43,875
But I see you from my little eye,

397
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,419
and my little eye says hi.

398
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,838
Now, see, now...

399
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:53,551
we emerge from the shadows
as gods on Mount Olympus.

400
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:57,430
Here's to the end of our pariah.

401
00:50:58,223 --> 00:51:01,392
Oh, my burden, my brother...

402
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:04,646
James Bond.

403
00:51:05,939 --> 00:51:07,941
-Goodbye, James.

404
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:13,529
You're popular tonight.

405
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:16,658
You can't run. It's too late.

406
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:23,623
It's already crawling under your skin.

407
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:27,168
Don't be alarmed. It's harmless fo us.

408
00:51:27,252 --> 00:51:29,754
-Just to him. So delicious.

409
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:38,846
Sir!

410
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,601
It is working.

411
00:51:43,685 --> 00:51:45,812
It is working. Only Spectre are dying.

412
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,574
Hello.

413
00:52:00,285 --> 00:52:02,787
Are you for my esco--

414
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:03,913
Huh?

415
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:05,540
No?

416
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:12,630
Go!

417
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:26,269
-Thank you. I'll take this.
- No!

418
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:27,603
-What was that?
- Get him!

419
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:38,531
Time to go. Let's go!

420
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:52,003
- It's clear.

421
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:53,087
-Huh?

422
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:57,258
May I cut in?

423
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,639
Go get him.
I'll hold them off.

424
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:05,183
- Cover the exits!

425
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:07,310
-Paloma.

426
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:12,857
Don't let them get away!

427
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,447
Have you got them?

428
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,448
Nearly.

429
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:22,742
No!

430
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:40,718
Down!

431
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:45,348
Get them!
Don't let them get away!

432
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:46,682
Paloma, I know you're busy,

433
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:48,851
but the curtain's about to come down
on this one.

434
00:53:48,935 --> 00:53:50,812
I can get a car.
Where do you need it?

435
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:51,813
I'll be right there.

436
00:53:58,236 --> 00:53:59,195
Stay down!

437
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:04,242
Move!

438
00:54:33,146 --> 00:54:35,106
-Huh?

439
00:54:43,698 --> 00:54:44,574
Come on!

440
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:54,167
Three weeks' training, really?

441
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:55,251
More or less.

442
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:56,586
We're still gonna need that car.

443
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:58,171
-Salud.
-Salud.

444
00:55:23,321 --> 00:55:26,365
-Where are you taking me?
-I'm taking you back to Mother, darling.

445
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:28,367
Mother? Oh, no, no, no.

446
00:55:32,622 --> 00:55:33,956
Oh. There you are.

447
00:55:41,631 --> 00:55:43,633
Oh! No!

448
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:52,308
-Stay there! You okay?

449
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:53,768
I'm great.

450
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:04,070
I'm gonna borrow
your plane. Sorry.

451
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:27,009
It's a shortcut.

452
00:56:41,274 --> 00:56:43,401
This is my stop. Goodbye.

453
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:48,030
-You were excellent.
-You too.

454
00:56:48,114 --> 00:56:49,532
Next time, stay longer.

455
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:50,741
-I will.
-Hey.

456
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:53,035
-A cigar for Felix.
-Thank you. Come on.

457
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,120
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

458
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:02,920
Come on, let's go.

459
00:57:03,004 --> 00:57:06,299
No, no, no, sir.
I am not getting on that.

460
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:10,094
Well, that's a shame
because we don't have a choice.

461
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:11,762
Let's go. Come on.

462
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:15,766
Okay, okay,
what have we got here?

463
00:57:31,324 --> 00:57:35,745
Sir, I just saved your life, okay?
Please remember that.

464
00:57:35,828 --> 00:57:39,457
So, could you please tell me
what the hell is going on?

465
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,958
Where are you taking me?

466
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:43,419
Somewhere safe.

467
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:11,739
At least make it look hard.

468
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,200
Thanks, Felix.
You walked me into a trap. Get in.

469
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:16,827
What trap?

470
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:18,663
Spectre's dead. Sit.

471
00:58:18,746 --> 00:58:20,247
- Who's dead?
-All of them.

472
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:21,332
Good.

473
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:26,462
What is this?
Explain it to me.

474
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:29,382
I don't have the words
to describe to someone like you.

475
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:30,633
Try one.

476
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:34,553
It's... perfect.

477
00:58:34,637 --> 00:58:36,138
A perfect what?

478
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:37,556
What? Assassin.

479
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,142
-Thank you, Bond. Your mission's done.
- Why didn't it kill me?

480
00:58:40,226 --> 00:58:41,686
You don't have to
answer those questions.

481
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:43,729
-Why Spectre?
-Bond, please stop asking these questions.

482
00:58:43,813 --> 00:58:44,814
Quiet!

483
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:45,940
Speak up.

484
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:49,902
Because you were never
the intended target.

485
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:51,737
He was a target? Why?

486
00:58:51,821 --> 00:58:54,115
I changed the DNA
like we decided.

487
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:56,242
Now the plan is complete
and I'm confused.

488
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:57,868
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who is "we"?

489
00:58:57,952 --> 00:58:59,453
-Did M make you build this?
-He is not allowed to do this.

490
00:58:59,537 --> 00:59:00,705
He is out of line here, Felix.

491
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:02,665
-Did M order you to kill Spectre?
-Ash.

492
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:04,417
-Don't answer that!
-Is M behind this?

493
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,751
-He is out of line!
-Felix!

494
00:59:05,835 --> 00:59:07,545
Ash, shut your mouth!

495
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:09,505
M. M helped me build it.

496
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:11,632
But please,
he does not have the vision

497
00:59:11,716 --> 00:59:13,342
-for how to use it.
-Well, who does? Who does?

498
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:17,638
Blofeld? How did he know
I was going to be there?

499
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:26,272
Whoa!

500
01:00:14,904 --> 01:00:16,363
I'm with Safin. You understand?

501
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:18,699
Yes. I am Dr. Obruchev.

502
01:00:18,783 --> 01:00:21,368
I know who you are.

503
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:25,039
I don't know about you...

504
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:28,626
but I got a feeling in my gut
Ash might not be on our side.

505
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:33,631
We need to have a conversation
about the company you keep.

506
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:34,840
I'm with you.

507
01:00:37,635 --> 01:00:38,677
That's a lot of blood.

508
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:44,767
So, where are we going?

509
01:00:46,477 --> 01:00:47,645
Get in the plane, Doctor.

510
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:50,064
This might be my last mission.
What do you think?

511
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:53,317
I think you're just looking
for an excuse not to help me.

512
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,860
-There you go.

513
01:00:54,944 --> 01:00:56,904
Paloma, she gave me
a cigar for you to smoke,

514
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,614
and you are gonna smoke it.

515
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:01,242
Nice, but maybe you should
hold on to that for now.

516
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:04,203
You just stay put.
Keep the pressure on that.

517
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:06,330
I'm gonna find us a way out.

518
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:08,791
I'll be over here.

519
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:11,126
You know, Felix,
we really need to stop meeting--

520
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:19,593
-Whoa.
-Shit.

521
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:22,513
I was such a big fan of his.

522
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:30,479
Felix!

523
01:01:43,534 --> 01:01:44,994
This doesn't look good.

524
01:01:45,953 --> 01:01:49,582
Come on, Felix.
We've been in worse than this. Let's go.

525
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:53,836
It's like back when I was a kid
on that shrimp boat.

526
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:55,671
You're from Milwaukee.

527
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:58,090
Am 1? I thought I made that up.

528
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:05,014
He got me.

529
01:02:06,682 --> 01:02:09,226
Just let me go.
Let me go.

530
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:17,526
-You got this?

531
01:02:19,862 --> 01:02:22,031
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

532
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:25,784
Make it worth it.

533
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:29,538
James...

534
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:33,167
it's a good life, isn't it?

535
01:02:35,127 --> 01:02:36,211
The best.

536
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:42,176
Felix.

537
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:45,971
Felix.

538
01:02:46,055 --> 01:02:47,097
Felix.

539
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,414
-Name?
-Bond.

540
01:05:20,876 --> 01:05:22,669
James Bond.

541
01:05:27,508 --> 01:05:28,842
How's retirement?

542
01:05:28,926 --> 01:05:29,760
Quiet.

543
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:35,099
Hi. Where's Obruchev?

544
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,267
I thought you two
would get along.

545
01:05:37,893 --> 01:05:39,061
Report, 007.

546
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:40,187
Thank you.

547
01:05:41,355 --> 01:05:42,856
00... 7.

548
01:05:44,566 --> 01:05:45,859
That must bother you.

549
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:50,531
Where is he?

550
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:52,407
He left me... for somebody else.

551
01:05:52,491 --> 01:05:53,575
It's--

552
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:55,577
-So, you lost him?
-You can go in.

553
01:05:55,661 --> 01:05:56,787
-Thank you.
-Thank y--

554
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,414
Alone, I'm afraid.

555
01:06:00,374 --> 01:06:02,209
Oh. Does that bother you?

556
01:06:09,258 --> 01:06:11,301
-I get why you shot him.
-Yeah, well,

557
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:14,054
everyone tries at least once.

558
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:21,270
Has this desk got bigger?

559
01:06:23,105 --> 01:06:24,982
Or have you got smaller?

560
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:30,487
I can't pretend there weren't
some sorry faces when you left us, Bond,

561
01:06:30,571 --> 01:06:33,365
but you fell so far off the grid

562
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,117
that we thought you must be dead.

563
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:41,290
Now, learning that you...
were, in fact, alive and well and...

564
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:46,336
working for the CIA, well...

565
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:50,924
Well, that really was a blow.

566
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:53,969
Well, they just asked so nicely.

567
01:06:55,596 --> 01:06:58,599
It's a shame
that you haven't lost your touch.

568
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:01,393
We wouldn't be in this mess.

569
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:04,313
This is your mess.

570
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:07,816
Blofeld tried to kill me in Cuba,

571
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,068
but someone hijacked his plan.

572
01:07:10,736 --> 01:07:15,699
And whoever stole your weapon
used it to wipe out Spectre instead.

573
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:18,368
Now your weapon is on the run

574
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:20,495
and nobody seems to know who has it.

575
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:23,457
So you can imagine
why I've come back to play.

576
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,917
We're looking into it.

577
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,919
I can identify the man
that took Obruchev.

578
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:28,712
And what do you want
in return, Bond?

579
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:30,964
Blofeld.

580
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:34,092
-Impossible. He's in Belmarsh.
-Yes.

581
01:07:34,176 --> 01:07:38,096
He ran a Spectre meeting in Cuba
from Belmarsh.

582
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:39,514
-How?
-No.

583
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:42,392
How? No one has access.
No one.

584
01:07:42,476 --> 01:07:46,104
Why didn't you shut it down?

585
01:07:46,188 --> 01:07:48,106
Why didn't you shut Heracles down?

586
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:51,068
I answer to the interests
of my country, not you.

587
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:52,027
And to Felix Leiter?

588
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:54,738
I certainly don't answer
to Felix Leiter.

589
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:56,782
Perhaps because he's dead.

590
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,748
I'm sorry.

591
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:08,543
I had a lot of respect for Leiter.

592
01:08:14,049 --> 01:08:17,135
Look, if you have information,
I'd be happy to receive it.

593
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:18,470
Get me into Belmarsh.

594
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:22,391
No. Blofeld's the only member of Spectre
still breathing. I can't risk that.

595
01:08:22,474 --> 01:08:25,894
Oh, but you will risk developing
a DNA-targeting weapon

596
01:08:25,978 --> 01:08:28,563
with a corrupt scientist for ten years?

597
01:08:28,647 --> 01:08:32,025
There was nothing to suggest
that Obruchev was working for anyone else.

598
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:34,945
-I had him down.
-My God, you're thirsty at the moment.

599
01:08:36,697 --> 01:08:39,491
You have no right
to speak to me that way.

600
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:43,287
You have no right to make insinuations
about my judgment.

601
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:46,957
If you've nothing left to give,
you are irrelevant.

602
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:51,128
You've done your bit
and we thank you for your service, again.

603
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:52,212
Goodbye.

604
01:08:53,714 --> 01:08:56,216
Moneypenny, send in 007.

605
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,509
You can go, Bond.

606
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:06,435
It's definitely the same desk.

607
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:12,524
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

608
01:09:17,946 --> 01:09:18,822
Go to Belmarsh.

609
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:23,493
I want everything that Blofeld listens to,
looks at and touches scanned.

610
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:25,704
Scan every corner of that cell.

611
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:30,250
Scan the whole prison.
In fact, scan the whole damn man.

612
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:33,128
Sir. I'll bring my gloves.

613
01:09:36,715 --> 01:09:39,217
James, uh...

614
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:42,637
what are you doing for dinner?

615
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:13,502
So, you're not dead?

616
01:10:13,585 --> 01:10:14,878
Hello, Q. I've missed you.

617
01:10:16,338 --> 01:10:17,964
Mmm! That smells great.

618
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:20,050
Were you expecting somebody?

619
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:22,886
Um... No. What-- Excuse me.

620
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:27,516
Oh. This is the first time I've--

621
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:29,226
He'll be here in 20 minutes.

622
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:30,560
I can't take my focus off--

623
01:10:30,644 --> 01:10:32,479
I need you to tell me
what's on that.

624
01:10:33,063 --> 01:10:34,439
No, I need to lay the table.

625
01:10:38,402 --> 01:10:40,695
You know,
they come with fur these days.

626
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:44,366
I want to be very clear
that I am not authorized to help you.

627
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:46,701
-And I have sworn--
-It's to do with Heracles.

628
01:10:49,329 --> 01:10:51,456
I presume M doesn't know
that this is happening.

629
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:55,544
No, but there's something going on, Q.
We need to find out what it is.

630
01:11:01,383 --> 01:11:03,135
Well, it's never 9:00 to 5:00, is it?

631
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:06,388
Thank you.

632
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:12,519
-Um, Bond?
- Yes?

633
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:14,938
Do you know
where this has been?

634
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,440
Everywhere, I should imagine.

635
01:11:17,566 --> 01:11:18,859
Into the sandbox.

636
01:11:23,864 --> 01:11:25,365
Oh. Thank you.

637
01:11:26,658 --> 01:11:28,368
Um, it's a database.

638
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:31,580
Don't touch that, please.

639
01:11:31,663 --> 01:11:32,914
What's the data?

640
01:11:32,998 --> 01:11:35,292
It's DNA. Multiple individuals.

641
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:36,710
What was M working on?

642
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,004
Something he should have
shut down years ago.

643
01:11:39,087 --> 01:11:40,630
- Oh, hello.
- What?

644
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:43,091
There's more. Hidden files.

645
01:11:43,175 --> 01:11:45,260
I was asked to recover what I could

646
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:48,472
from Obruchev's hard drive
just after the explosion,

647
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:50,474
and I have
a pretty good feeling that...

648
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:52,434
this is what was missing.

649
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:54,936
Yeah. A complete disk.

650
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:03,653
So, Obruchev is working for someone
who managed to kill all of Spectre?

651
01:12:03,737 --> 01:12:05,030
Not all of them.

652
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:07,991
Blofeld.

653
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,659
Can you show me the other files?

654
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:11,495
Mm-hmm.

655
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,960
Wait, this can't just be Spectre.

656
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:21,421
Oh, my God.

657
01:12:22,923 --> 01:12:23,924
There are thousands.

658
01:12:25,467 --> 01:12:26,468
Who are they?

659
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:31,306
They're in categories.
I'm gonna need more time to organize--

660
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:32,974
There have been, uh, breaches

661
01:12:33,058 --> 01:12:36,144
round the world of databases
holding DNA information.

662
01:12:37,062 --> 01:12:39,314
-We've been tracking them.
-Ours?

663
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:42,526
I can't imagine they're leaving us out,
whoever they are.

664
01:12:42,609 --> 01:12:46,238
Well, Blofeld will know who they are.
Q, you need to get me into Belmarsh.

665
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:51,576
Well, there's only one person
he'll speak to.

666
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:54,496
Who? M says no one has access.

667
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:56,581
-Really?
-Did he?

668
01:12:57,165 --> 01:12:58,208
What's that?

669
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:03,088
Can I just have one nice evening, please,
before the world explodes?

670
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:05,382
Who has access? Who?

671
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:14,057
- Morning.
- Morning.

672
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,518
New patient. He's weird.

673
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:18,853
You can't say that.

674
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:25,819
I'm sorry I'm late.

675
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:30,240
I wasn't expecting a new patient.

676
01:13:35,412 --> 01:13:37,998
Sorry if I surprised you.

677
01:13:38,707 --> 01:13:40,959
No. I like surprises.

678
01:13:44,254 --> 01:13:47,382
You're very attractive
for a psychotherapist.

679
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:50,051
Must be dangerous
for your clients.

680
01:13:54,222 --> 01:13:56,725
They are usually more of a danger
to themselves.

681
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:02,230
Foxgloves.

682
01:14:02,981 --> 01:14:04,065
Beautiful.

683
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:07,152
-Did you choose them?
-Yes.

684
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:08,903
I found them friendly.

685
01:14:08,987 --> 01:14:13,199
You know if you eat them,
they can cause your heart to just...

686
01:14:16,036 --> 01:14:17,537
stop.

687
01:14:18,622 --> 01:14:20,248
Then I'll make sure not to.

688
01:14:27,589 --> 01:14:29,090
Do you know a lot about flowers?

689
01:14:29,174 --> 01:14:32,927
My father had a garden.
He taught me.

690
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:35,722
He died when I was young,
but my interest...

691
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:38,391
remained.

692
01:14:39,476 --> 01:14:41,394
It's difficult to lose a parent.

693
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:44,939
Especially at a young age.

694
01:14:45,732 --> 01:14:46,858
Yes,

695
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:50,862
death has a particular effect
on children...

696
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:53,073
doesn't it?

697
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:57,952
What effect did it have on you?

698
01:14:58,536 --> 01:15:03,124
Profound.
But I saved a life once.

699
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:06,336
I think that had
more of an effect.

700
01:15:07,796 --> 01:15:08,880
Why is that?

701
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:11,174
Saving someone's life

702
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:14,386
connects you to them forever,

703
01:15:14,469 --> 01:15:16,096
the same as taking it.

704
01:15:17,472 --> 01:15:18,723
They belong to you.

705
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,980
I'm not very good
at talking about myself,

706
01:15:26,064 --> 01:15:28,525
so I brought a memory box.

707
01:15:31,528 --> 01:15:33,154
I thought it might interest you.

708
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:37,701
Sometimes objects can be
more evocative than memories.

709
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:52,757
I never forgot your eyes
under the ice.

710
01:15:54,634 --> 01:15:55,927
They needed me.

711
01:15:58,221 --> 01:16:01,558
It is a shock to see them
SO many years later.

712
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:05,228
They still need me.

713
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:08,356
I am rather taken by them.

714
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:09,441
What do you want?

715
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:11,359
Just a favor.

716
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:13,194
You owe me.

717
01:16:14,446 --> 01:16:15,780
You murdered my mother.

718
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:19,284
And your father killed
my entire family.

719
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:23,246
Parents.

720
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:27,584
I need you to visit someone for me,
wearing this.

721
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:30,503
It's harmless to you.

722
01:16:35,258 --> 01:16:37,594
You are the only one who can do it.

723
01:16:38,762 --> 01:16:39,971
No.

724
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:42,432
Why would I do anything for you?

725
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:43,683
Because I...

726
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:48,521
am a man willing to kill
the person you love most.

727
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,608
I've already lost
everyone I've ever loved.

728
01:16:53,026 --> 01:16:54,986
There is nothing
you can threaten me with.

729
01:16:57,447 --> 01:17:00,074
That is very sad to hear, Madeleine.

730
01:17:05,497 --> 01:17:07,540
But it is not true...

731
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:13,296
is it?

732
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:23,223
Madeleine Swann, really?

733
01:17:23,807 --> 01:17:26,184
Well, yes.
We took your information seriously,

734
01:17:26,267 --> 01:17:28,228
but that was five years ago.

735
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:29,479
Nothing came up.

736
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:31,689
Well, she's very smart
and very good at hiding things.

737
01:17:31,773 --> 01:17:32,857
She's a useful asset.

738
01:17:32,941 --> 01:17:35,318
She's the only psychiatrist
he agreed to speak to.

739
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,487
I had to exercise my judgment--

740
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:39,405
Your judgment is the problem.

741
01:17:40,782 --> 01:17:42,992
That weapon was designed
to save lives

742
01:17:43,076 --> 01:17:45,954
and to eradicate collateral damage
for our agents.

743
01:17:47,539 --> 01:17:49,749
A clean, accurate shot every time.

744
01:17:50,667 --> 01:17:52,460
But it had to be off the books.

745
01:17:53,545 --> 01:17:56,339
There are enough holes
in our national security.

746
01:17:58,258 --> 01:18:00,218
If the world knows what this can do--

747
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:01,427
-They'd kill for it.
-Mmm.

748
01:18:02,554 --> 01:18:03,555
Look...

749
01:18:05,765 --> 01:18:10,103
if it's an error, it's on my shoulders,
fair and square.

750
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:14,899
I've dedicated my life
to defending this country.

751
01:18:16,234 --> 01:18:18,945
I believe in defending
the principles of this...

752
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:20,196
Of this.

753
01:18:22,115 --> 01:18:24,742
But we used to be able to
get into a room with the enemy.

754
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:26,661
We could look him in the eye.

755
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:28,037
And now, the...

756
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:32,542
the enemy is just floating
in the ether.

757
01:18:33,418 --> 01:18:35,044
We don't even know
what they're after.

758
01:18:36,254 --> 01:18:37,255
Blofeld.

759
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:41,384
We managed to access
a database of their targets.

760
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:42,552
"We"?

761
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:46,180
Oh, for fuck's sake.

762
01:18:47,432 --> 01:18:48,683
I see.

763
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:51,728
And after Blofeld,
what do they want?

764
01:18:53,021 --> 01:18:54,022
Well, it's hard to say.

765
01:18:54,105 --> 01:18:57,901
I mean, I would imagine world leaders,
innocent civilians,

766
01:18:57,984 --> 01:18:59,527
freedom, you know,
that sort of thing.

767
01:18:59,611 --> 01:19:02,322
Oh, good, well, just the usual.

768
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:03,823
Just the usual.

769
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:12,081
Blofeld was communicating with his agents
in Cuba through a bionic eye...

770
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:14,542
which we've now retrieved.

771
01:19:14,626 --> 01:19:16,169
You're welcome.

772
01:19:16,753 --> 01:19:19,631
Spectre's destruction's
going to have huge consequences.

773
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:24,135
Whoever did this is going to be
very dangerous and very powerful.

774
01:19:26,346 --> 01:19:29,182
We need all the information
that we can gather.

775
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:30,266
Sir.

776
01:19:31,726 --> 01:19:32,810
Sir.

777
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,647
Bond.

778
01:19:36,606 --> 01:19:38,024
So the rumors are true.

779
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:39,943
-You look well.
-Tanner.

780
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:42,862
Sir, there's been a development.

781
01:19:45,782 --> 01:19:49,035
They were just dropping,
one right after the other.

782
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:51,371
It was disturbing, to say the least.

783
01:19:51,454 --> 01:19:53,456
Wait till you see
what it looks like up close.

784
01:19:54,082 --> 01:19:56,960
-Uh, Bond's in the office.
-What?

785
01:20:00,588 --> 01:20:04,258
Oh, Bond.
My God, I haven't seen you in, uh--

786
01:20:04,342 --> 01:20:05,426
How is your retirement?

787
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:07,929
Shut up, Q.
I know he's staying with you.

788
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:10,264
-And you're not in the clear either.
-What happened?

789
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:12,100
He's been reinstated as a double-0.

790
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,354
-Double-0 what?
-What have you got?

791
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:23,111
Q has studied the blood samples I gathered
from the victims of the funeral.

792
01:20:23,194 --> 01:20:25,029
Just look at this.

793
01:20:25,113 --> 01:20:27,240
- What are we looking at?

794
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:30,994
This is the funeral of one of
the dead Spectre agents from Cuba.

795
01:20:31,077 --> 01:20:33,079
And here are
the members of their family

796
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:35,331
who made physical contact
with the corpse.

797
01:20:36,249 --> 01:20:38,960
We found Heracles
in the blood samples of all of them.

798
01:20:41,004 --> 01:20:42,839
Now, that's some good work, Nomi.

799
01:20:42,922 --> 01:20:44,882
Thank you, sir.
Double-0 what?

800
01:20:44,966 --> 01:20:48,511
-What are they?
-They're-- They're nanobots.

801
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:51,055
Right.

802
01:20:51,139 --> 01:20:53,349
Microscopic bio-robots
that can enter your system

803
01:20:53,433 --> 01:20:55,268
by the slightest contact with your skin.

804
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:05,236
Programmed with DNA
to target specific individuals.

805
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:07,613
Heracles was--

806
01:21:09,115 --> 01:21:13,119
It was designed to be
the most efficient weapon in our arsenal.

807
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:17,373
Passing through people harmlessly
before reaching its intended target.

808
01:21:17,457 --> 01:21:19,751
But Obruchev
modified the nanobots

809
01:21:19,834 --> 01:21:21,836
so they can kill anyone
related to the target.

810
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:22,754
Anyone?

811
01:21:22,837 --> 01:21:25,631
Well, since it's DNA-based,
with further modifications, yes.

812
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:29,218
Families, certain genetic traits.

813
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:32,263
Single-nucleotide variants
and polymorphisms

814
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:35,058
that could target a range
from individuals

815
01:21:35,141 --> 01:21:36,684
to whole ethnicities.

816
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:40,772
-You infect enough people...
-And the people become the weapon.

817
01:21:40,855 --> 01:21:44,275
It was never intended to be
a weapon of mass destruction.

818
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:46,819
It was in--

819
01:21:49,697 --> 01:21:51,282
I need to call the prime minister.

820
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,786
Tanner, quarantine the families
from the funeral.

821
01:21:54,869 --> 01:21:55,870
Yes, sir.

822
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:59,707
And, Q, hack into Blofeld's
bionic eye. See what you can find.

823
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:02,794
-You've got your wish.

824
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:05,755
Go to Blofeld
and see what you can get out of him.

825
01:22:05,838 --> 01:22:07,840
And find that cockroach Obruchev.

826
01:22:08,716 --> 01:22:09,717
Sir.

827
01:22:13,596 --> 01:22:15,014
We don't have a trail.

828
01:22:15,723 --> 01:22:19,143
Logan Ash. State Department.
Ex-State Department.

829
01:22:19,227 --> 01:22:20,937
Find him, you'll find Obrucheuv.

830
01:22:21,896 --> 01:22:24,357
Um... Good luck.

831
01:22:25,608 --> 01:22:28,069
Thanks.

832
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:56,973
I'll be outside when you're done
with your important preparation.

833
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:00,726
I'll be just a moment.

834
01:23:01,978 --> 01:23:02,979
It's fine.

835
01:23:22,248 --> 01:23:24,333
Blofeld's eyeball unlocked.

836
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:32,258
Accessing received media stream.

837
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,427
I know you and she have a history,

838
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:37,430
but we've kept a close eye
on her over the years.

839
01:23:38,139 --> 01:23:39,348
She's been very compliant.

840
01:23:39,432 --> 01:23:42,476
If Bond does anything weird in there,
you'll be doing me a huge favor,

841
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,854
so don't make it
too easy for him, okay?

842
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:46,230
Okay.

843
01:23:46,314 --> 01:23:48,566
He's the most valuable asset
this country has.

844
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:52,069
I know you and he have a history,

845
01:23:52,153 --> 01:23:54,113
but don't let him
get in your head.

846
01:23:54,197 --> 01:23:55,656
If you feel yourself
losing control--

847
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:59,035
Oh, Tanner, relax.

848
01:23:59,118 --> 01:24:00,620
I'm not gonna lose...

849
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:06,918
control.

850
01:24:12,298 --> 01:24:14,550
Dr. Swann, good afternoon.

851
01:24:20,431 --> 01:24:21,641
Mr. Bond.

852
01:24:26,312 --> 01:24:27,438
007.

853
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:35,404
Six-seven.
Special cell two now locked off.

854
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:42,620
Segregation unit secure.

855
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:44,914
This is where we leave you.
Good luck.

856
01:24:45,456 --> 01:24:46,666
Just get us a name.

857
01:24:54,048 --> 01:24:58,219
Must be nice to catch up
with an old friend so regularly.

858
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:00,596
We're closer than ever.

859
01:25:02,139 --> 01:25:05,726
That was awkward.
Does he have that effect on all women?

860
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:08,771
- Fifty-fifty. It's unpredictable.

861
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:14,193
Isolated in HSU.

862
01:25:22,994 --> 01:25:24,287
You're shaking.

863
01:25:25,746 --> 01:25:27,540
It's not an ideal situation.

864
01:25:57,778 --> 01:25:59,113
Open the door.

865
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:01,073
Open the door.

866
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:03,743
Don't.

867
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:05,578
What is it?

868
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:09,123
James, you don't know what this is.

869
01:26:10,166 --> 01:26:11,667
Don't make me do this.

870
01:26:11,751 --> 01:26:13,044
Please.

871
01:26:13,127 --> 01:26:14,754
Right. Open the doors.

872
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:16,130
-Open the door.
- Open it.

873
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:17,340
-What--

874
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:22,053
Where are you going?

875
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:24,638
Home.

876
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:29,352
- I'll get her.
- Wait.

877
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:32,605
-He won't talk without her.
-Just wait.

878
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,775
Special delivery.

879
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:53,376
James.

880
01:26:54,168 --> 01:26:55,378
Hello, Blofeld.

881
01:26:57,838 --> 01:27:00,633
Perhaps you can help me.

882
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:04,261
Cuba was quite the party.

883
01:27:04,345 --> 01:27:06,764
-Happy birthday, by the way.
-Thank you.

884
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:09,266
I'm trying to piece together
what happened.

885
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:13,104
I mean, there you were,
or here you were,

886
01:27:13,187 --> 01:27:16,690
with the world's most powerful people,
your friends, all in one room,

887
01:27:16,774 --> 01:27:19,151
a noose around my neck,

888
01:27:19,235 --> 01:27:22,488
and your hands on
the most valuable weapon in existence.

889
01:27:23,656 --> 01:27:25,449
It's like a--

890
01:27:25,533 --> 01:27:29,120
It was like a testimony
to your greatness.

891
01:27:29,203 --> 01:27:33,290
A celebration
of all that is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

892
01:27:33,958 --> 01:27:35,334
Yeah, James.

893
01:27:37,628 --> 01:27:39,255
Yeah.

894
01:27:39,338 --> 01:27:41,382
But then it all went wrong,

895
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:42,550
didn't it?

896
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:46,679
My sweet James,
what do you want?

897
01:27:46,762 --> 01:27:48,889
Your enemies are closing in, Blofeld.

898
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:55,729
And the biggest twist here
is that if you tell me who they are,

899
01:27:55,813 --> 01:27:57,231
I could save your life.

900
01:27:57,314 --> 01:28:00,151
Mmm, my avenging angel.

901
01:28:00,234 --> 01:28:03,028
My chaser of lost causes.

902
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:05,656
Now you even chase mine.

903
01:28:05,739 --> 01:28:07,533
But you're asking
the wrong question.

904
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:12,204
Yeah, Cuba was a disappointment,
but we all cry on our birthday.

905
01:28:13,372 --> 01:28:17,376
You need to ask yourself,
why are we here?

906
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:20,546
Accessing media file 472.

907
01:28:22,089 --> 01:28:24,049
Hmm. Looking sharp, Bond.

908
01:28:24,133 --> 01:28:25,676
473.

909
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,304
474.

910
01:28:29,763 --> 01:28:31,182
475.

911
01:28:33,017 --> 01:28:36,479
476, 477, 478.

912
01:28:40,483 --> 01:28:42,109
479.

913
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:52,203
Logan Ash.
A pleasure fo meet you.

914
01:28:52,286 --> 01:28:53,412
Oh, my God, that's him.

915
01:28:53,496 --> 01:28:55,122
I am sorry for your loss.

916
01:28:55,206 --> 01:28:58,209
I believe you know
who [I represent and work for?

917
01:28:58,292 --> 01:29:00,377
We have an opportunity for you.

918
01:29:01,545 --> 01:29:04,381
You keep coming back to me.
I thought I'd never see you again,

919
01:29:04,465 --> 01:29:08,427
-but fate draws us back together.
-Yes. Q's got eyes on Logan Ash.

920
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:11,805
-Go.
-Yep. Let me know what happens.

921
01:29:11,889 --> 01:29:13,682
Now your enemy is my enemy.

922
01:29:13,766 --> 01:29:15,017
How did that happen?

923
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:16,644
Well, you live long enough...

924
01:29:16,727 --> 01:29:17,853
- Yeah.

925
01:29:17,937 --> 01:29:19,021
Look at us.

926
01:29:20,064 --> 01:29:24,068
Two old men in a hole trying to work out
who's playing tricks on us.

927
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:29,156
She still loves you.
Did you know that?

928
01:29:29,949 --> 01:29:32,326
And you broke her heart.
And she betrayed you.

929
01:29:32,409 --> 01:29:33,536
She is irrelevant.

930
01:29:34,203 --> 01:29:37,039
Mmm, I wouldn't be
so quick to dismiss.

931
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:40,376
You said it yourself,
she's very good at hiding things.

932
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:44,672
And when her secret
finds its way out, and it will,

933
01:29:44,755 --> 01:29:46,298
it'll be the death of you.

934
01:29:46,382 --> 01:29:48,092
Just give me a name.

935
01:29:48,175 --> 01:29:49,510
-Madeleine.
-Oh--

936
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:53,639
Please, just--
Please, no games.

937
01:29:54,974 --> 01:29:56,100
Madeleine.

938
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:00,771
Do you know what?
The two of you should come see me.

939
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:02,815
A little couples therapy.

940
01:30:02,898 --> 01:30:05,901
I simply have to see your face
when she tells you the truth.

941
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:09,613
Just tell me who they are,
Blofeld...

942
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:13,867
and then I'll leave.
I'll leave you on your own.

943
01:30:13,951 --> 01:30:17,496
No, I don't want you to leave.
We're just getting reacquainted.

944
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:25,838
Oh, all right. Come.

945
01:30:27,089 --> 01:30:30,342
You were unusually patient.
I need to give you something

946
01:30:30,426 --> 01:30:33,262
so that you didn't have to make
all this way for nothing. Come.

947
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:40,811
Careful, Bond.

948
01:30:41,437 --> 01:30:42,438
It was me.

949
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:45,608
You destroyed Spectre?

950
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:48,902
No.
Vesper's grave.

951
01:30:48,986 --> 01:30:51,113
Madeleine didn't do a thing.
It was all me.

952
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:55,743
I knew you'd come visit it.
I just needed to wait for the bon moment.

953
01:30:55,826 --> 01:30:59,496
She led you straight there
from the goodness of her heart.

954
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:02,499
And then you left her for me.

955
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:03,792
It doesn't matter.

956
01:31:03,876 --> 01:31:06,879
Oh, but it does.
She still does, doesn't she?

957
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:09,173
My poor little cuckoo.

958
01:31:10,424 --> 01:31:13,636
You were always
SO very, very sensitive.

959
01:31:16,597 --> 01:31:17,890
This isn't working.

960
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:19,183
Keep going.

961
01:31:19,266 --> 01:31:22,770
All this wasted time,
the life you could have had.

962
01:31:23,479 --> 01:31:27,399
And the reason all of this
is so beautiful, so exquisitely beautiful,

963
01:31:27,483 --> 01:31:30,402
is that you're coming to me
looking for answers,

964
01:31:30,486 --> 01:31:33,364
whereas the one person
who knows it all is she.

965
01:31:33,447 --> 01:31:34,531
It's Madeleine.

966
01:31:34,615 --> 01:31:37,785
She holds the secrets you need.
All of them.

967
01:31:37,868 --> 01:31:39,578
I didn't need to kill you.

968
01:31:39,662 --> 01:31:41,330
I'd already broken you.

969
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:43,749
I wanted to give you
an empty world...

970
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:47,002
like the one you gave me.

971
01:31:47,086 --> 01:31:49,421
It's enough
to almost make me regret it.

972
01:31:50,464 --> 01:31:51,548
Almost.

973
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:01,016
Die.

974
01:32:02,685 --> 01:32:03,686
Mmm?

975
01:32:06,146 --> 01:32:08,357
-Die, Blofeld. Die.

976
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,067
Jesus. Open the door.

977
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:11,568
- Bond!

978
01:32:11,652 --> 01:32:12,695
-Bond!

979
01:32:13,487 --> 01:32:14,613
-Bond!

980
01:32:14,697 --> 01:32:18,075
-Open the door. Bond!

981
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:19,535
-Cuckoo.

982
01:32:19,618 --> 01:32:22,579
-What the hell are you thinking?
-Yes, I know how to interrogate an asset.

983
01:32:22,663 --> 01:32:23,664
This interrogation is over.

984
01:32:23,747 --> 01:32:25,582
Tanner, don't lecture me!

985
01:32:25,666 --> 01:32:28,168
Bond, you have violated
the most important rule

986
01:32:28,252 --> 01:32:29,837
-in the whole bloody playbook.

987
01:32:36,343 --> 01:32:37,344
Don't move.

988
01:32:47,604 --> 01:32:49,648
I'm gonna need those, I'm afraid.

989
01:33:01,577 --> 01:33:02,578
He's dead.

990
01:33:04,788 --> 01:33:08,333
It's a good thing you're not actually
related, or you'd be dead too.

991
01:33:09,835 --> 01:33:12,129
-How do I get this off?
- You don't. You can't.

992
01:33:14,047 --> 01:33:17,509
Nanobots aren't just for Christmas.

993
01:33:18,135 --> 01:33:21,263
Once Heracles is in your system,
it's there forever.

994
01:33:26,894 --> 01:33:30,105
-Did they find the car?
-We traced it, but she abandoned it.

995
01:33:30,189 --> 01:33:32,816
They searched her flat.
She hasn't been home.

996
01:33:33,901 --> 01:33:35,944
-Is she one of them?
-I don't know.

997
01:33:36,028 --> 01:33:40,199
James, do you have any idea
where she might have gone?

998
01:33:41,742 --> 01:33:44,369
No. I don't know her at all.

999
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:31,834
Is that for me?

1000
01:34:34,795 --> 01:34:35,879
No.

1001
01:34:38,632 --> 01:34:39,800
Then why did you come?

1002
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:42,469
Because you told me to.

1003
01:34:44,346 --> 01:34:46,306
I didn't think
you would remember.

1004
01:34:47,015 --> 01:34:48,809
I remember everything.

1005
01:34:48,892 --> 01:34:51,687
You need to tell me
who gave you the poison, Madeleine.

1006
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:54,773
Is he dead?

1007
01:34:55,816 --> 01:34:56,984
Yes, he's dead.

1008
01:34:58,402 --> 01:34:59,403
Good.

1009
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:04,032
He told me you didn't betray me.

1010
01:35:05,951 --> 01:35:08,412
I understand
you're not built to trust people.

1011
01:35:09,705 --> 01:35:10,706
Neither are you.

1012
01:35:11,582 --> 01:35:13,208
Then we were fools for trying.

1013
01:35:14,167 --> 01:35:15,377
I wanted to.

1014
01:35:22,593 --> 01:35:24,970
I don't know
if you wanted me to come here...

1015
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:29,016
or why you tried to kill Blofeld,
or who gave you the poison to do it,

1016
01:35:29,099 --> 01:35:30,642
or how long
you've been working for them,

1017
01:35:30,726 --> 01:35:32,269
but I do know...

1018
01:35:34,813 --> 01:35:39,234
that for what felt like
five minutes of my life,

1019
01:35:39,318 --> 01:35:41,028
I wanted everything with you.

1020
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:46,116
And it's not because
I didn't trust.

1021
01:35:49,953 --> 01:35:51,455
It was just that feeling.

1022
01:35:55,584 --> 01:35:59,004
Now I've come here to find out
who gave you the poison...

1023
01:36:00,213 --> 01:36:02,966
but I'm not going to leave here
without you knowing

1024
01:36:03,842 --> 01:36:05,844
that I have loved you...

1025
01:36:07,346 --> 01:36:09,014
and I will love you,

1026
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:14,144
and I do not regret a single moment
of my life that led me to you...

1027
01:36:17,314 --> 01:36:19,107
except when I put you on that train.

1028
01:36:24,071 --> 01:36:25,781
Do you know
the worst thing about you?

1029
01:36:27,741 --> 01:36:29,076
My timing?

1030
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:32,621
Don't.

1031
01:36:41,213 --> 01:36:43,548
My sense of humor?

1032
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,968
Don't.

1033
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:50,931
What?

1034
01:36:51,014 --> 01:36:52,432
You look...

1035
01:36:52,516 --> 01:36:54,101
You look incredible.

1036
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:07,990
This is Mathilde.

1037
01:37:10,325 --> 01:37:11,493
Um...

1038
01:37:12,077 --> 01:37:14,204
Hello. I'm James.

1039
01:37:31,388 --> 01:37:34,683
Sir, we've located Logan Ash.
007 wants a word.

1040
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:36,727
Well done, 007.

1041
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:39,187
Thank you, sir.
Permission for a capture or Kill.

1042
01:37:39,271 --> 01:37:41,857
Have we cleared this with the Americans?

1043
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:44,651
Granted. And thank you for asking.

1044
01:37:45,318 --> 01:37:46,403
By the book, sir.

1045
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:48,572
Your predecessor was less deferential.

1046
01:37:49,656 --> 01:37:53,243
To be fair,
Commander Bond gave me the lead.

1047
01:37:53,827 --> 01:37:55,829
Well, I'm glad to see you two
getting along.

1048
01:37:55,912 --> 01:37:57,622
-Sir.

1049
01:37:57,706 --> 01:37:58,874
Have you located Dr. Swann?

1050
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:01,209
Nothing, I'm afraid, sir.

1051
01:38:01,835 --> 01:38:02,836
Thank you.

1052
01:38:14,598 --> 01:38:16,475
-Bonne nuit.
-Bonne nuit.

1053
01:38:16,558 --> 01:38:19,019
-Dites bonne nuit monsieur.
-Bonne nuit.

1054
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:20,812
Bonne nuit.

1055
01:38:32,866 --> 01:38:34,201
She's not yours.

1056
01:38:35,869 --> 01:38:37,037
But the--

1057
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:38,872
Okay, the blue eyes, the--

1058
01:38:40,457 --> 01:38:41,875
She's not yours.

1059
01:38:43,877 --> 01:38:44,878
Okay.

1060
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:47,756
I have something to show you.

1061
01:38:51,051 --> 01:38:52,302
Another child?

1062
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:06,942
What is it with your dad
and secret rooms?

1063
01:39:07,025 --> 01:39:08,026
Talk to me.

1064
01:39:09,194 --> 01:39:10,987
I wanted to bring you here before.

1065
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:13,865
To tell you everything.

1066
01:39:15,117 --> 01:39:18,703
Blofeld ordered my father
to assassinate this family.

1067
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:20,497
The boy survived.

1068
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:24,209
His name is Lyutsifer Safin.

1069
01:39:28,046 --> 01:39:30,882
When I was a little girl,
he came here to kill my father...

1070
01:39:32,801 --> 01:39:35,011
but he found me
and my mother instead.

1071
01:39:37,139 --> 01:39:38,473
He spared my life.

1072
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:42,227
And now he's back.

1073
01:39:42,894 --> 01:39:44,938
-And what does he want?
-Revenge?

1074
01:39:47,524 --> 01:39:48,525
Me?

1075
01:39:54,197 --> 01:39:55,198
Who were they?

1076
01:39:55,282 --> 01:39:57,033
Spectre's poisoners.

1077
01:39:57,117 --> 01:40:01,830
My father held a banquet for them,
used their own recipe in the dessert.

1078
01:40:01,913 --> 01:40:02,956
Dioxin.

1079
01:40:04,708 --> 01:40:08,295
They would have suffered horribly.
Scarred him for life.

1080
01:40:09,546 --> 01:40:11,089
The family had an island.

1081
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:14,176
They called it the Poison Garden.

1082
01:40:16,052 --> 01:40:19,139
Oh, so...
Blofeld took it from them

1083
01:40:19,222 --> 01:40:20,348
and kept running it,

1084
01:40:21,433 --> 01:40:23,685
and now this Safin
has taken it back.

1085
01:40:29,608 --> 01:40:32,944
Q, find one Lyutsifer Safin.

1086
01:40:33,028 --> 01:40:35,530
Whereabouts unknown
and no recent photographs,

1087
01:40:35,614 --> 01:40:38,033
but I'm gonna send you
some images of him as a boy.

1088
01:40:38,116 --> 01:40:41,912
And a picture of an island.
So, you know, do your best.

1089
01:40:41,995 --> 01:40:44,873
And I'm gonna need a plane
to get there, a big one.

1090
01:40:48,793 --> 01:40:50,420
I'll send you my location shortly.

1091
01:40:54,966 --> 01:40:56,343
You're going to find him?

1092
01:40:59,012 --> 01:41:02,224
There are a thousand reasons
why we need to find this man.

1093
01:41:04,517 --> 01:41:06,686
You just gave me a reason
to kill him.

1094
01:41:42,514 --> 01:41:43,515
How is it?

1095
01:41:57,404 --> 01:41:58,405
Excuse me.

1096
01:41:59,114 --> 01:41:59,948
Yes?

1097
01:42:00,031 --> 01:42:01,032
Bond.

1098
01:42:01,116 --> 01:42:02,325
Did you find the island?

1099
01:42:02,409 --> 01:42:04,411
Yes, it's part of a chain

1100
01:42:04,494 --> 01:42:06,871
in disputed waters
between Japan and Russia.

1101
01:42:06,955 --> 01:42:10,542
There's a chemical plant
dating back to the Second World War.

1102
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:12,502
Seems fo have had quite a history.

1103
01:42:13,211 --> 01:42:16,756
Sir, Japanese intelligence have reported
suspicious activity on the island.

1104
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:19,759
Q, bring up the satellite images
I just sent through.

1105
01:42:20,969 --> 01:42:22,804
These were taken
over the last few days.

1106
01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:26,683
If that is Safin there--

1107
01:42:26,766 --> 01:42:28,435
Then Heracles is there too.

1108
01:42:28,518 --> 01:42:29,936
Where do you need
this plane, Bond?

1109
01:42:30,020 --> 01:42:31,021
Hang on, Q.

1110
01:42:31,104 --> 01:42:33,148
Did 007 manage to locate Logan Ash?

1111
01:42:33,231 --> 01:42:36,192
She's closing in on him.
I'll send you her location.

1112
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:46,745
I thought she was following
Logan Ash, not me.

1113
01:42:46,828 --> 01:42:47,996
What? She is.

1114
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:49,956
James, where are you?

1115
01:42:54,294 --> 01:42:55,545
Put her in the back.

1116
01:42:57,547 --> 01:42:59,966
There you are.
In you get. Watch your head.

1117
01:43:13,688 --> 01:43:16,399
Q, I am gonna need
that plane, quickly.

1118
01:43:16,483 --> 01:43:19,569
I'm near @rland NATO base.
You think you can get it to me?

1119
01:43:19,652 --> 01:43:21,071
Right, yes. We'll be there.

1120
01:43:21,738 --> 01:43:22,822
Thank you.

1121
01:43:22,906 --> 01:43:23,865
Maman...

1122
01:43:51,017 --> 01:43:51,893
Maman...

1123
01:44:29,389 --> 01:44:30,390
James.

1124
01:44:43,778 --> 01:44:45,447
Mathilde!

1125
01:45:54,349 --> 01:45:55,808
They're above us!

1126
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:24,170
Get out of here!

1127
01:46:24,254 --> 01:46:25,213
James!

1128
01:48:02,935 --> 01:48:03,978
You stay here.

1129
01:48:04,854 --> 01:48:06,022
I'll be back soon.

1130
01:48:06,981 --> 01:48:09,734
Anybody comes through that door,
you shoot them.

1131
01:48:09,817 --> 01:48:11,069
Unless it's me.

1132
01:48:12,028 --> 01:48:14,447
You be quiet, okay?
Stay really quiet.

1133
01:49:30,606 --> 01:49:31,691
Hey!

1134
01:49:47,457 --> 01:49:48,499
Go! Go!

1135
01:49:55,298 --> 01:49:56,299
There! Run him over!

1136
01:50:24,202 --> 01:50:26,204
Nice moves, Bond.

1137
01:50:26,287 --> 01:50:29,540
You won't be able to stop him...

1138
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,127
...so, why don't you
help me out, brother?

1139
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:35,546
I had a brother.

1140
01:50:37,965 --> 01:50:39,509
His name was Felix Leiter.

1141
01:52:01,841 --> 01:52:03,175
Need a ride?

1142
01:52:04,886 --> 01:52:05,887
Where have you been?

1143
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:08,264
Chasing after your lead.

1144
01:52:11,642 --> 01:52:12,810
Ash?

1145
01:52:12,894 --> 01:52:13,978
Dead.

1146
01:52:16,772 --> 01:52:18,357
They took Dr. Swann.

1147
01:52:19,317 --> 01:52:20,401
And her daughter.

1148
01:52:22,695 --> 01:52:25,281
I didn't know she had a daughter.

1149
01:52:26,115 --> 01:52:27,491
Did M get my plane?

1150
01:52:28,868 --> 01:52:31,537
Our plane.
I'm coming with you.

1151
01:52:34,749 --> 01:52:35,708
Thank you, 007.

1152
01:52:59,482 --> 01:53:00,691
Hello, Q.

1153
01:53:00,775 --> 01:53:01,776
Bond.

1154
01:53:03,277 --> 01:53:05,112
Sorry to get you out of bed.

1155
01:53:06,697 --> 01:53:09,617
The objectives of this mission
are threefold.

1156
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:13,663
Confirm the presence of Heracles.
Kill Obruchev and Safin.

1157
01:53:13,746 --> 01:53:17,041
Get Dr. Swann and her daughter
off the island.

1158
01:53:17,124 --> 01:53:19,877
And, Bond, I hope they're there.

1159
01:53:20,461 --> 01:53:21,796
Thank you, sir.

1160
01:53:21,879 --> 01:53:22,880
Sir.

1161
01:53:24,590 --> 01:53:28,094
Permission for Commander Bond
to be redesignated as 007.

1162
01:53:30,846 --> 01:53:31,847
It's just a number.

1163
01:53:31,931 --> 01:53:32,932
Very well.

1164
01:53:33,516 --> 01:53:34,517
Agreed.

1165
01:53:35,476 --> 01:53:36,769
Good luck.

1166
01:53:36,852 --> 01:53:38,813
Bond, your watch.

1167
01:53:41,232 --> 01:53:44,568
It contains a limited-radius
electromagnetic pulse.

1168
01:53:45,319 --> 01:53:47,571
It'll short any circuit
in a hardwired network

1169
01:53:47,655 --> 01:53:48,781
if you get close enough.

1170
01:53:48,864 --> 01:53:49,949
Mm-hmm.

1171
01:53:51,409 --> 01:53:52,618
And how strong is it?

1172
01:53:53,661 --> 01:53:55,287
It's fairly strong.

1173
01:53:55,830 --> 01:53:57,373
"Fairly strong." What's that mean?

1174
01:53:57,456 --> 01:54:00,376
We haven't had the chance
to test it properly. Just be careful.

1175
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:02,336
Right, this is Q.DAR.

1176
01:54:03,004 --> 01:54:05,131
It will map the space
as you move through it.

1177
01:54:07,550 --> 01:54:08,843
Don't touch that.

1178
01:54:10,094 --> 01:54:12,555
And smart blood will track you--

1179
01:54:13,264 --> 01:54:15,182
whoops-- and your vitals.

1180
01:54:21,897 --> 01:54:24,692
Bond, you don't mind a shot or two
whilst at work?

1181
01:54:24,775 --> 01:54:26,527
-Shall we?
-Well, I haven't had a drink

1182
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:27,862
-for three or four hou--

1183
01:54:27,945 --> 01:54:29,572
-Hours.
-Wow.

1184
01:54:30,364 --> 01:54:32,575
Doesn't sound like you.

1185
01:54:34,285 --> 01:54:35,494
-Ow!

1186
01:54:35,578 --> 01:54:36,954
Good.

1187
01:54:37,038 --> 01:54:39,457
I assume you know
how the stealthy bird works.

1188
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:40,624
No, no idea.

1189
01:54:41,333 --> 01:54:42,668
Gravity.

1190
01:55:02,938 --> 01:55:04,648
Welcome back, Mr. Safin.

1191
01:55:04,732 --> 01:55:07,026
Welcome to your family.

1192
01:55:07,610 --> 01:55:09,236
How are you progressing?

1193
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:11,363
So, so good, Mr. Safin.
So, so good.

1194
01:55:11,447 --> 01:55:12,865
My request?

1195
01:55:13,532 --> 01:55:14,533
Svetlana?

1196
01:55:23,334 --> 01:55:24,376
Continue.

1197
01:55:24,877 --> 01:55:26,295
What is that?

1198
01:55:26,378 --> 01:55:27,421
Insurance.

1199
01:55:28,005 --> 01:55:31,842
A simple hair falls from your head,
and now I have your life in my hands.

1200
01:55:33,844 --> 01:55:35,221
And yours.

1201
01:55:36,764 --> 01:55:39,600
How damaged you must be
to threaten a little girl.

1202
01:55:41,227 --> 01:55:43,354
You're any less damaged?

1203
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:46,148
You love a killer.

1204
01:55:47,858 --> 01:55:50,569
You bore his child
despite his rejection.

1205
01:55:51,529 --> 01:55:53,739
You've hidden and lied
your whole life.

1206
01:55:54,323 --> 01:55:56,242
You will do anything...

1207
01:55:56,325 --> 01:55:57,493
To survive.

1208
01:56:01,539 --> 01:56:04,375
You understand me
the same way I understand you.

1209
01:56:07,253 --> 01:56:08,295
Move.

1210
01:56:18,013 --> 01:56:19,765
My father's garden.

1211
01:56:20,391 --> 01:56:22,518
It was his toxic treasure.

1212
01:56:22,601 --> 01:56:24,395
Let me show her.

1213
01:56:24,478 --> 01:56:25,479
Give her to me.

1214
01:56:26,188 --> 01:56:27,189
No.

1215
01:56:29,150 --> 01:56:30,734
I can protect her.

1216
01:56:34,697 --> 01:56:36,031
Mathilde.

1217
01:56:45,583 --> 01:56:46,584
Mathilde.

1218
01:56:47,168 --> 01:56:48,794
It's a poison garden...

1219
01:56:50,254 --> 01:56:52,256
but it's perfectly safe.

1220
01:56:52,339 --> 01:56:53,632
-Shh.

1221
01:56:54,717 --> 01:56:56,218
My father made this.

1222
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:00,931
He loved his plants so much,
he would sing to them.

1223
01:57:03,767 --> 01:57:06,103
I want to show you
one of my favorites.

1224
01:57:09,648 --> 01:57:12,401
Some of these plants
are very dangerous,

1225
01:57:12,484 --> 01:57:14,737
but not all of them
are for hurting people.

1226
01:57:15,321 --> 01:57:18,115
I have plants that can do
all sorts of things.

1227
01:57:24,747 --> 01:57:26,040
Mathilde!

1228
01:57:27,208 --> 01:57:28,209
No.

1229
01:57:29,752 --> 01:57:31,670
This one makes you
do as you're told.

1230
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,465
So you never misbehave,

1231
01:57:34,548 --> 01:57:36,091
and you're always good.

1232
01:57:36,175 --> 01:57:38,052
You mustn't misbehave, Mathilde.

1233
01:57:39,470 --> 01:57:41,180
And neither must your mother.

1234
01:57:43,849 --> 01:57:44,850
Ever.

1235
01:57:48,187 --> 01:57:50,105
-Do you like it here?
-No.

1236
01:57:51,815 --> 01:57:53,192
Well, you will learn to.

1237
01:57:54,068 --> 01:57:56,487
I grew up here, and you will too.

1238
01:58:00,658 --> 01:58:02,743
Such a beautiful child.

1239
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:06,622
Perhaps we should have some tea.

1240
01:58:06,705 --> 01:58:07,915
-No.
- Make her see the light.

1241
01:58:07,998 --> 01:58:09,959
No. No, you can't separate us!

1242
01:58:10,042 --> 01:58:11,335
-Mathilde!
-Maman!

1243
01:58:17,091 --> 01:58:18,217
Don't worry.

1244
01:58:20,594 --> 01:58:21,887
You have me.

1245
01:58:31,063 --> 01:58:34,191
As soon as you have a line of sight
on the island, drop alfitude,

1246
01:58:34,275 --> 01:58:35,567
stay below radar.

1247
01:58:40,155 --> 01:58:41,824
You ever flown
one of these things before?

1248
01:58:41,907 --> 01:58:44,118
-Nope.

1249
01:58:51,208 --> 01:58:54,503
Don't forget fo release the chute,
and open the wings.

1250
01:58:54,586 --> 01:58:56,088
Gravity isn't always your friend.

1251
01:59:12,354 --> 01:59:15,149
Look for a concrete structure
on the west side of the island.

1252
01:59:16,191 --> 01:59:17,901
That's your best bet for getting in.

1253
02:00:04,156 --> 02:00:05,616
Coming up for air, Q.

1254
02:00:06,533 --> 02:00:07,868
Right, good.

1255
02:00:07,951 --> 02:00:11,622
You should be entering
a World War II-era sub pen.

1256
02:00:12,498 --> 02:00:15,501
Doesn't seem to get much activity,
but look out for cameras anyway.

1257
02:00:16,668 --> 02:00:18,003
Use your watch, Bond.

1258
02:00:53,455 --> 02:00:54,456
Okay.

1259
02:00:54,540 --> 02:00:55,666
Ah. There you go.

1260
02:00:56,583 --> 02:00:58,001
Sir, they're in.

1261
02:00:58,085 --> 02:00:59,503
Yes, we have it.

1262
02:00:59,586 --> 02:01:01,880
You should be able to see
the chemical plant's architecture.

1263
02:01:01,964 --> 02:01:02,965
Which one's Bond?

1264
02:01:03,048 --> 02:01:07,177
He's the psi.
He's the trident thingy.

1265
02:01:07,261 --> 02:01:08,804
Give us the layout.

1266
02:01:08,887 --> 02:01:10,180
Right.

1267
02:01:10,264 --> 02:01:14,101
You're at the edge
of a toxic merry-go-round.

1268
02:01:14,685 --> 02:01:17,688
The main activity should be
towards the central hub,

1269
02:01:17,771 --> 02:01:19,231
which is directly above you.

1270
02:01:52,723 --> 02:01:54,183
Bond.

1271
02:01:54,266 --> 02:01:56,059
Bond, there's something--

1272
02:01:56,143 --> 02:01:59,146
There's something big up ahead.
I can't work out what it is. It's--

1273
02:01:59,897 --> 02:02:01,815
These walls must be thick.

1274
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:09,281
Bond.

1275
02:02:10,574 --> 02:02:12,784
Bond? 007, do you read me?

1276
02:02:12,868 --> 02:02:16,121
- We've lost them.
-They've entered a blind spot, sir.

1277
02:02:16,205 --> 02:02:18,499
I can't work out
what it is they've walked into.

1278
02:02:18,582 --> 02:02:20,167
Well, just get them back.

1279
02:02:53,033 --> 02:02:55,285
Well, will you look
at those doors.

1280
02:02:56,245 --> 02:02:57,871
This was a missile silo.

1281
02:02:57,955 --> 02:02:58,956
Right.

1282
02:03:00,832 --> 02:03:01,833
Let's go.

1283
02:03:09,550 --> 02:03:10,926
- Everybody, over there.

1284
02:03:11,009 --> 02:03:12,010
In the corner. Now.

1285
02:03:12,761 --> 02:03:14,429
-What? How?
- Move!

1286
02:03:14,513 --> 02:03:16,473
Move! On the ground!

1287
02:03:17,933 --> 02:03:18,934
Alarm.

1288
02:03:21,478 --> 02:03:22,604
Down, boy.

1289
02:03:39,788 --> 02:03:41,790
What are you doing?

1290
02:03:41,873 --> 02:03:46,253
You cannot explode laboratory, please.

1291
02:03:49,798 --> 02:03:51,925
This is suicide mission.

1292
02:03:52,634 --> 02:03:53,927
Come on.

1293
02:03:54,011 --> 02:03:56,555
You will never leave this island alive.

1294
02:04:02,853 --> 02:04:04,062
That was the farm.

1295
02:04:05,564 --> 02:04:07,065
And this is the factory.

1296
02:04:20,120 --> 02:04:21,538
They're mass-producing it.

1297
02:04:21,622 --> 02:04:23,040
Nomi, come and look at this.

1298
02:04:23,123 --> 02:04:25,626
Well, look, you cannot stop it, mister.

1299
02:04:25,709 --> 02:04:27,836
We have big plan, you know.

1300
02:04:27,919 --> 02:04:29,588
-We have big numbers.
-What is it?

1301
02:04:29,671 --> 02:04:32,924
It's a simulation.
They're not just attacking individuals...

1302
02:04:33,008 --> 02:04:34,259
They're going to kill millions.

1303
02:04:34,343 --> 02:04:37,554
It will not fit in a suitcase
this time, lady.

1304
02:04:37,638 --> 02:04:39,723
He's really getting on my nerves.

1305
02:04:39,806 --> 02:04:41,183
Well, shut him up.

1306
02:04:42,517 --> 02:04:44,478
Ow!

1307
02:04:45,187 --> 02:04:46,855
My nose.

1308
02:04:49,983 --> 02:04:52,486
We have to destroy
this whole facility.

1309
02:04:52,569 --> 02:04:54,613
There is no need for violence.

1310
02:04:54,696 --> 02:04:56,865
Mr. Safin, they use explosives.

1311
02:04:56,948 --> 02:04:58,241
Shut up.

1312
02:04:58,325 --> 02:04:59,701
Mr. Bond...

1313
02:05:00,661 --> 02:05:04,539
you have something of mine
and I have something of yours.

1314
02:05:05,832 --> 02:05:08,669
Why don't you come up
and we can talk about it?

1315
02:05:08,752 --> 02:05:10,087
Like adults.

1316
02:05:12,547 --> 02:05:14,466
Safin. Where is he?

1317
02:05:19,513 --> 02:05:21,098
If I don't come back...

1318
02:05:22,724 --> 02:05:23,725
blow it all to shit.

1319
02:05:24,810 --> 02:05:26,436
We don't have
enough explosives for that.

1320
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:28,313
Yeah, but they don't know that.

1321
02:05:47,582 --> 02:05:50,419
He said you must drink.
For your health.

1322
02:05:50,502 --> 02:05:54,005
Do you trust him?
He made me kill your last master.

1323
02:05:54,089 --> 02:05:56,216
Why do you think
he let you join him?

1324
02:05:56,299 --> 02:05:59,678
I think he wants you to drink.

1325
02:06:01,972 --> 02:06:04,933
I want him
to give me my daughter back.

1326
02:06:05,016 --> 02:06:08,228
He said if you behave,
you'll see her. Drink.

1327
02:06:18,572 --> 02:06:20,574
Do you know what this flower does?

1328
02:06:26,246 --> 02:06:27,622
It makes you blind.

1329
02:06:28,915 --> 02:06:32,711
Just a drop of this in your eye,
and you'll never see again.

1330
02:06:35,005 --> 02:06:37,966
Losing one eye is a tragedy.
Losing two...

1331
02:06:38,550 --> 02:06:40,802
-No games.
-This is not a game.

1332
02:07:19,716 --> 02:07:20,759
Welcome.

1333
02:07:22,469 --> 02:07:23,470
On the floor.

1334
02:07:32,687 --> 02:07:33,772
Your sidearm.

1335
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:36,441
Careful.

1336
02:07:41,738 --> 02:07:43,573
She is light as a feather.

1337
02:07:43,657 --> 02:07:44,658
All right!

1338
02:07:55,752 --> 02:07:56,753
Please, sit.

1339
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:04,553
It's going to be all right.

1340
02:08:05,762 --> 02:08:07,848
Promise you,
it's going to be all right.

1341
02:08:08,431 --> 02:08:09,724
James Bond.

1342
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:12,894
History of violence.

1343
02:08:12,978 --> 02:08:14,437
License to kill.

1344
02:08:15,605 --> 02:08:18,066
Vendetta with Ernst Blofeld.

1345
02:08:18,149 --> 02:08:20,443
In love with Madeleine Swann.

1346
02:08:22,070 --> 02:08:24,447
I could be speaking to my own reflection.

1347
02:08:24,531 --> 02:08:26,449
We've made slightly different choices.

1348
02:08:26,533 --> 02:08:27,534
No.

1349
02:08:27,617 --> 02:08:30,787
We've just developed different methods
for the same goal.

1350
02:08:32,122 --> 02:08:34,124
Only your skills die with your body.

1351
02:08:35,041 --> 02:08:37,836
Mine will survive long after I'm gone.

1352
02:08:38,670 --> 02:08:42,090
And life is all about
leaving something behind.

1353
02:08:44,301 --> 02:08:45,302
Isn't it?

1354
02:08:46,678 --> 02:08:48,513
Doesn't have to be ugly.

1355
02:08:49,806 --> 02:08:52,601
You leave my baby alone,
I leave yours.

1356
02:08:52,684 --> 02:08:53,894
What do you think?

1357
02:08:57,022 --> 02:08:59,190
I think you're right.

1358
02:09:00,692 --> 02:09:01,693
Thank you.

1359
02:09:01,776 --> 02:09:03,528
I think we are the same.

1360
02:09:04,654 --> 02:09:08,617
We both know what it feels like
to have everything taken from us

1361
02:09:08,700 --> 02:09:10,535
before we're even in the fight.

1362
02:09:11,536 --> 02:09:18,084
It would have been nice to have a chance,
you know, don't you think?

1363
02:09:18,168 --> 02:09:21,588
Just... we all should get a chance.

1364
02:09:22,172 --> 02:09:24,132
But this thing that you're building,

1365
02:09:24,215 --> 02:09:28,887
it puts everyone,
the whole world on a battlefield.

1366
02:09:28,970 --> 02:09:31,056
Nobody gets a chance.

1367
02:09:34,434 --> 02:09:37,562
The thing that no one wants to admit

1368
02:09:37,646 --> 02:09:41,691
is that most people want things
to happen to them.

1369
02:09:41,775 --> 02:09:46,613
We tell each other lies about
the fight for free will and independence,

1370
02:09:46,696 --> 02:09:49,282
but we don't really want that.

1371
02:09:50,241 --> 02:09:52,285
We want to be told how to live

1372
02:09:53,411 --> 02:09:55,622
and then die when we are not looking.

1373
02:09:57,082 --> 02:10:00,085
People want oblivion,

1374
02:10:01,169 --> 02:10:04,756
and a few of us are born
to build it for them.

1375
02:10:06,716 --> 02:10:10,929
So, here I am, their invisible god...

1376
02:10:12,514 --> 02:10:15,266
sneaking under their skin.

1377
02:10:16,393 --> 02:10:19,062
You know that history isn't kind
to those who play God.

1378
02:10:19,145 --> 02:10:20,313
And you don't?

1379
02:10:21,940 --> 02:10:26,361
We both eradicate people
to make the world a better place.

1380
02:10:27,112 --> 02:10:28,780
I just want to be a little...

1381
02:10:30,907 --> 02:10:32,158
tidier.

1382
02:10:32,742 --> 02:10:34,744
Without collateral.

1383
02:10:35,453 --> 02:10:39,708
I want the world to evolve,
yet you want it to stay the same.

1384
02:10:40,875 --> 02:10:42,168
Let's face it...

1385
02:10:45,338 --> 02:10:46,840
I've made you redundant.

1386
02:10:46,923 --> 02:10:47,966
No.

1387
02:10:49,175 --> 02:10:51,636
Not as long as there are people
like you in the world.

1388
02:10:53,096 --> 02:10:59,394
And with all due respect to the enormity
of your tidy achievements,

1389
02:11:00,270 --> 02:11:05,483
all you're really doing is standing
in a very long line of angry little men.

1390
02:11:05,567 --> 02:11:09,029
I'm not angry, just passionate.

1391
02:11:10,947 --> 02:11:13,575
Disable your explosives,
get off my island,

1392
02:11:13,658 --> 02:11:17,537
and you can take
this precious little angel with you.

1393
02:11:19,247 --> 02:11:20,248
And Madeleine?

1394
02:11:22,083 --> 02:11:24,753
-She stays.
-You know I can't do that.

1395
02:11:25,754 --> 02:11:28,298
Ah. That is a shame.

1396
02:11:29,090 --> 02:11:31,342
She really hoped you would.

1397
02:11:31,426 --> 02:11:33,887
She knows
it's her only path to survive.

1398
02:11:33,970 --> 02:11:35,972
You have her tell me that.

1399
02:11:36,848 --> 02:11:41,269
What mother wouldn't sacrifice herself
for her own child?

1400
02:11:43,646 --> 02:11:45,065
Is that what happened to yours?

1401
02:11:51,029 --> 02:11:53,990
My mother lay at my feet
as I watched her die.

1402
02:11:57,285 --> 02:11:59,829
Wait! Wait. Wait.

1403
02:12:03,333 --> 02:12:04,709
I'll do whatever you want.

1404
02:12:04,793 --> 02:12:06,086
Yes, you will.

1405
02:12:09,547 --> 02:12:10,757
I apologize.

1406
02:12:14,260 --> 02:12:15,345
I'm sorry.

1407
02:12:16,513 --> 02:12:18,473
Simple choices, Mr. Bond.

1408
02:12:19,641 --> 02:12:22,352
Like do you want to die
in front of your daughter?

1409
02:12:23,561 --> 02:12:25,939
Or do you want your daughter
to die in front of you?

1410
02:12:26,022 --> 02:12:28,691
No. No. No. No. No.

1411
02:12:30,485 --> 02:12:31,611
I am sorry.

1412
02:12:33,196 --> 02:12:34,197
I'm sorry.

1413
02:12:36,491 --> 02:12:38,201
Look at your father, Mathilde.

1414
02:12:41,955 --> 02:12:43,498
This is power.

1415
02:12:43,581 --> 02:12:44,582
I'm sorry.

1416
02:12:45,416 --> 02:12:48,294
I'm truly, truly sorry.

1417
02:12:57,971 --> 02:12:59,305
James!

1418
02:12:59,389 --> 02:13:00,974
-Where is she?

1419
02:13:05,728 --> 02:13:08,064
The first shipment is on the dock
ready for pickup, Doctor.

1420
02:13:08,148 --> 02:13:09,274
Very good.

1421
02:13:31,713 --> 02:13:34,132
If you don't want
my protection, then...

1422
02:13:35,675 --> 02:13:36,843
off you go.

1423
02:13:47,103 --> 02:13:50,273
Move. Our first buyers are arriving.

1424
02:14:03,036 --> 02:14:06,289
Sir, I've just detected
some suspicious activity.

1425
02:14:06,372 --> 02:14:09,042
Several high-speed transports
are headed towards the island.

1426
02:14:09,125 --> 02:14:12,212
Origin unknown. Still no sign of 007.

1427
02:14:13,838 --> 02:14:16,257
Come on, Bond. Where the hell are you?

1428
02:14:16,883 --> 02:14:20,261
This is hopeless situation, lady. Please.

1429
02:14:22,972 --> 02:14:24,724
- Bond.

1430
02:14:25,391 --> 02:14:26,476
Bond.

1431
02:14:27,352 --> 02:14:29,896
The party is larger
than the reservation.

1432
02:14:29,979 --> 02:14:32,440
Look, lady, please,
please just let me go.

1433
02:14:33,858 --> 02:14:35,735
There was never gonna be
a way out.

1434
02:14:37,195 --> 02:14:40,281
Stop this nonsense.
You don't have a chance, anyways.

1435
02:14:42,158 --> 02:14:45,370
Hey. Hey.
I have a good vial for your people,

1436
02:14:45,453 --> 02:14:47,830
good for West African diaspora.
It can be a good thing.

1437
02:14:47,914 --> 02:14:49,082
-Whoal

1438
02:15:04,722 --> 02:15:07,058
You know, I do not need laboratory

1439
02:15:07,141 --> 02:15:09,978
to exterminate your entire race
from the face of the Earth.

1440
02:15:11,729 --> 02:15:14,065
-Do you know what time it is?
-What?

1441
02:15:14,649 --> 02:15:15,900
Time to die.

1442
02:15:15,984 --> 02:15:17,860
No!

1443
02:15:27,578 --> 02:15:29,289
Move! Move!

1444
02:15:34,252 --> 02:15:37,130
They dropped down to a lower level.
There has to be a stairwell down.

1445
02:15:37,213 --> 02:15:38,423
Maman!

1446
02:15:41,759 --> 02:15:42,802
Maman!

1447
02:15:46,889 --> 02:15:48,850
Mathilde. Mathilde.

1448
02:16:04,240 --> 02:16:05,366
We should go.

1449
02:16:06,034 --> 02:16:07,118
Yeah.

1450
02:16:07,702 --> 02:16:08,995
It's Q. Do you read me?

1451
02:16:10,288 --> 02:16:12,040
Come in, 007. It's Q.

1452
02:16:17,211 --> 02:16:18,838
Traffic. We have traffic.

1453
02:16:18,921 --> 02:16:20,256
I think we just got buzzed.

1454
02:16:20,340 --> 02:16:21,716
Those are two Russian MiGs.

1455
02:16:21,799 --> 02:16:23,217
Traffic. TCAS, you have control.

1456
02:16:23,301 --> 02:16:25,345
I understand,
and I'm doing the best that I can.

1457
02:16:25,428 --> 02:16:27,305
Just please wait.

1458
02:16:28,139 --> 02:16:30,224
Sir, I've got the Navy,
the Japanese, the Russians,

1459
02:16:30,308 --> 02:16:31,476
all breathing down my neck,

1460
02:16:31,559 --> 02:16:35,396
demanding to know why we've got
a C-17 circling a disputed island.

1461
02:16:38,816 --> 02:16:40,943
Don't tell them anything just yet.

1462
02:16:59,170 --> 02:17:00,296
Ah. Just in time.

1463
02:17:01,005 --> 02:17:02,507
Nomi, you know...

1464
02:17:03,216 --> 02:17:05,760
Madeleine, Mathilde, they're my...

1465
02:17:05,843 --> 02:17:06,844
-Hey.
-Hi.

1466
02:17:10,390 --> 02:17:12,809
Q. Q, are you there?

1467
02:17:12,892 --> 02:17:13,893
Yes, Bond.

1468
02:17:14,477 --> 02:17:18,147
Do we have any Royal Naval vessels
in the immediate vicinity?

1469
02:17:18,773 --> 02:17:19,941
Uh, yes. Why?

1470
02:17:20,024 --> 02:17:22,610
We are gonna need
an immediate strike on this location.

1471
02:17:22,693 --> 02:17:27,240
This whole island,
it's a manufacturing plant for Heracles.

1472
02:17:27,323 --> 02:17:29,534
We don't have clearance
for missile strikes, do we?

1473
02:17:30,118 --> 02:17:31,202
Mm-mmm.

1474
02:17:31,285 --> 02:17:33,162
Bond, there's something else
you should know.

1475
02:17:33,246 --> 02:17:35,998
Several unidentified ships
are headed your way.

1476
02:17:36,624 --> 02:17:39,085
They're coming after Heracles.
How far out?

1477
02:17:39,168 --> 02:17:41,462
Uh, 20 minutes.

1478
02:17:41,546 --> 02:17:43,464
Q, patch me through.

1479
02:17:44,340 --> 02:17:46,259
-007.
-M.

1480
02:17:46,342 --> 02:17:49,220
Our operation is attracting
a lot of international attention.

1481
02:17:49,929 --> 02:17:51,347
We're seeing what we can do.

1482
02:17:51,431 --> 02:17:52,432
Come on.

1483
02:17:54,058 --> 02:17:55,101
Let's go.

1484
02:18:02,483 --> 02:18:05,862
It's going to get
very cold out there, so...

1485
02:18:06,863 --> 02:18:08,281
I want you to have this.

1486
02:18:10,658 --> 02:18:11,909
That'll keep you warm.

1487
02:18:17,123 --> 02:18:19,876
I have to finish this. For us.

1488
02:18:20,960 --> 02:18:22,003
I know.

1489
02:18:32,221 --> 02:18:33,723
I'll just be a minute.

1490
02:18:40,480 --> 02:18:41,814
I've got them.

1491
02:18:43,065 --> 02:18:44,233
This might come in handy.

1492
02:18:45,651 --> 02:18:46,694
Thank you.

1493
02:19:09,509 --> 02:19:11,260
Q, talk to me.

1494
02:19:11,344 --> 02:19:14,388
Our uninvited guests
are 15 minutes away.

1495
02:19:14,931 --> 02:19:16,766
Bond, M here.

1496
02:19:16,849 --> 02:19:19,435
The situation is diplomatically complex.

1497
02:19:19,519 --> 02:19:22,647
We don't have a choice.
Fire on my mark.

1498
02:19:22,730 --> 02:19:24,815
If we launch,
the Russians, the Japanese

1499
02:19:24,899 --> 02:19:27,193
and even the Americans will want answers.

1500
02:19:27,276 --> 02:19:28,736
Well, don't give them any.

1501
02:19:31,447 --> 02:19:32,990
Rational minds, Bond.

1502
02:19:33,074 --> 02:19:35,910
I'm trying fo save this
from escalating to all-out war.

1503
02:19:37,370 --> 02:19:41,832
Mallory, if we don't do this,
there will be nothing left to save.

1504
02:19:43,876 --> 02:19:44,877
Fire on my mark.

1505
02:19:45,836 --> 02:19:48,381
007, there's another problem.
That room you were just in.

1506
02:19:48,464 --> 02:19:51,050
Yes, I know, I know,
I've got to open the blast doors.

1507
02:19:51,133 --> 02:19:54,136
Otherwise our missiles will bounce off it
like they've hit a trampoline.

1508
02:19:54,220 --> 02:19:56,097
Yes, I know, I know.

1509
02:19:57,807 --> 02:19:58,975
Find the control room.

1510
02:19:59,058 --> 02:20:01,894
It should be in a tower
just above the blast doors.

1511
02:20:01,978 --> 02:20:04,605
The missiles will take
about nine minutes from launch.

1512
02:20:04,689 --> 02:20:06,941
Do you think you can do it
before the ships arrive?

1513
02:20:07,024 --> 02:20:08,526
Plenty of time, plenty of time.

1514
02:23:24,972 --> 02:23:27,558
Bond. Bond, do you read me?

1515
02:23:29,059 --> 02:23:31,312
Yeah.

1516
02:23:31,395 --> 02:23:32,688
Yeah, Q.

1517
02:23:32,772 --> 02:23:35,524
-I read you.
-Sounds like you're in a rugby scrum.

1518
02:23:35,608 --> 02:23:37,610
I just showed someone your watch.

1519
02:23:39,069 --> 02:23:40,738
Really blew their mind.

1520
02:23:43,157 --> 02:23:46,202
Right, good.
Now, did you find the control room?

1521
02:23:47,787 --> 02:23:50,623
Well, my Russian is a little rusty,
but I think so, yeah.

1522
02:24:04,386 --> 02:24:05,387
Okay, Q.

1523
02:24:05,471 --> 02:24:08,182
I've done some research.
Old schematics--

1524
02:24:08,265 --> 02:24:10,309
Q, I am gonna need some...

1525
02:24:10,392 --> 02:24:11,477
Yes?

1526
02:24:13,103 --> 02:24:14,522
-Bond?

1527
02:24:16,982 --> 02:24:17,983
Hello?

1528
02:24:18,067 --> 02:24:20,069
-Power.
- Power?

1529
02:24:20,152 --> 02:24:22,738
Right, the infrastructure
must go back to the 1950s,

1530
02:24:22,822 --> 02:24:26,033
so it's going to be an overly complicated
and intricate switching system.

1531
02:24:26,826 --> 02:24:30,538
Now, the order in which you engage it
will need to be extremely precise.

1532
02:24:31,288 --> 02:24:33,624
-You're looking for a control panel.

1533
02:24:33,707 --> 02:24:36,168
-There should be a counterweight clutch.

1534
02:24:37,086 --> 02:24:40,172
So, listen very carefully, 007.
The first thing you need fo do...

1535
02:24:40,256 --> 02:24:41,590
Got it.

1536
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:43,843
I think.

1537
02:24:57,982 --> 02:24:59,650
Yep, that's it. Launch the missiles.

1538
02:24:59,733 --> 02:25:03,320
- Not until you're clear.
-Q, tell M to launch the missiles now.

1539
02:25:04,530 --> 02:25:05,531
Okay. Okay, okay.

1540
02:25:06,115 --> 02:25:07,116
Understood.

1541
02:25:07,825 --> 02:25:10,077
M, Bond says fire.

1542
02:25:11,537 --> 02:25:13,205
HMS Dragon here.

1543
02:25:13,289 --> 02:25:14,290
Admiral.

1544
02:25:14,373 --> 02:25:15,416
Sir.

1545
02:25:16,125 --> 02:25:17,293
M here.

1546
02:25:17,376 --> 02:25:18,711
What are my instructions?

1547
02:25:19,461 --> 02:25:21,422
You have permission to launch.

1548
02:25:21,505 --> 02:25:23,299
Roger. Launching the strike.

1549
02:25:37,813 --> 02:25:40,274
Missiles airborne. Nine minutes out.

1550
02:26:09,261 --> 02:26:10,596
No.

1551
02:26:11,805 --> 02:26:13,390
No. No, no!

1552
02:26:46,006 --> 02:26:49,927
Quite a mess you've made.
Like an animal.

1553
02:27:18,831 --> 02:27:24,086
Now we are both poisoned
with heartbreak.

1554
02:27:26,463 --> 02:27:29,717
Two heroes in a tragedy
of our own making.

1555
02:27:37,182 --> 02:27:40,978
Anyone we touch, we are their curse.

1556
02:27:41,854 --> 02:27:43,814
A stroke to their cheek...

1557
02:27:44,481 --> 02:27:45,774
a kiss...

1558
02:27:47,317 --> 02:27:49,486
would kill them instantly.

1559
02:27:54,408 --> 02:27:55,534
Yes...

1560
02:27:56,785 --> 02:27:58,037
Madeleine.

1561
02:28:00,706 --> 02:28:04,543
Yes, Mathilde.

1562
02:28:21,268 --> 02:28:23,437
You made me do this, you see.

1563
02:28:28,567 --> 02:28:30,569
This was your choice.

1564
02:29:18,117 --> 02:29:20,160
Q. Q, are you there?

1565
02:29:20,244 --> 02:29:21,370
Bond, there you are.

1566
02:29:21,453 --> 02:29:22,663
Are they safe, Q?

1567
02:29:22,746 --> 02:29:25,124
Yes, they're safe.

1568
02:29:25,207 --> 02:29:27,084
Bond, have you left the island?

1569
02:29:27,876 --> 02:29:30,170
There's a slight problem
with the blast doors.

1570
02:29:31,255 --> 02:29:32,422
Won't take a sec.

1571
02:29:34,007 --> 02:29:35,467
No, no, no. Bond...

1572
02:29:36,218 --> 02:29:39,346
The missiles have already launched.
Just get out of there.

1573
02:29:49,773 --> 02:29:51,900
Q, how dol I...

1574
02:29:52,776 --> 02:29:55,195
how do I destroy this?

1575
02:29:55,988 --> 02:29:57,739
If the silo doors are open,

1576
02:29:57,823 --> 02:29:59,867
-the missiles will deal with it
-No. No, no.

1577
02:29:59,950 --> 02:30:03,787
If you get it on you,
how do you get it off?

1578
02:30:03,871 --> 02:30:05,914
You know as well as I do
that you can't.

1579
02:30:05,998 --> 02:30:07,583
It's permanent.

1580
02:30:07,666 --> 02:30:11,003
It's eternal.
Which is why we have to destroy It.

1581
02:30:11,086 --> 02:30:13,547
For Christ's sake, James,
Just get off the island.

1582
02:30:14,339 --> 02:30:16,758
It's harmless
unless you're near fo the target.

1583
02:30:19,052 --> 02:30:22,389
Yeah. Well, that's not gonna work.

1584
02:30:28,353 --> 02:30:29,730
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1585
02:30:32,149 --> 02:30:33,400
It's for Madeleine.

1586
02:30:37,571 --> 02:30:38,989
It's all right, Q.

1587
02:30:40,199 --> 02:30:41,408
It's all all right.

1588
02:30:43,577 --> 02:30:45,162
Would you put Madeleine on, please?

1589
02:30:45,245 --> 02:30:47,289
Yes, of course. How stupid of me.

1590
02:30:52,461 --> 02:30:54,922
Nomi, come in.
Can you put Madeleine on?

1591
02:30:56,506 --> 02:30:57,507
Madeleine.

1592
02:31:05,098 --> 02:31:06,642
- James.
-Madeleine.

1593
02:31:07,309 --> 02:31:08,852
- I'm here.

1594
02:31:09,436 --> 02:31:10,604
Where are you?

1595
02:31:12,522 --> 02:31:13,523
Is it done?

1596
02:31:14,483 --> 02:31:16,985
-James?
-Yes. Yes, he's dead.

1597
02:31:17,069 --> 02:31:18,153
Are you both there?

1598
02:31:18,237 --> 02:31:19,238
Yes.

1599
02:31:20,989 --> 02:31:23,408
Good. You're safe. That's good.

1600
02:31:24,618 --> 02:31:25,869
Have you left?

1601
02:31:29,498 --> 02:31:31,208
No. Um...

1602
02:31:31,291 --> 02:31:33,543
I'm not gonna make it.

1603
02:31:36,046 --> 02:31:37,047
What?

1604
02:31:40,217 --> 02:31:41,051
No.

1605
02:31:41,134 --> 02:31:42,844
- You promised.
-Madeleine.

1606
02:31:43,887 --> 02:31:45,264
Just get off that island.

1607
02:31:47,557 --> 02:31:48,892
I know you can do this.

1608
02:31:51,853 --> 02:31:54,648
Everything's good now.

1609
02:31:56,358 --> 02:31:58,193
There's no one left to hurt us.

1610
02:31:58,819 --> 02:31:59,861
Madeleine...

1611
02:32:03,115 --> 02:32:04,533
you have made...

1612
02:32:06,368 --> 02:32:10,956
the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.

1613
02:32:12,833 --> 02:32:14,584
She's perfect.

1614
02:32:18,797 --> 02:32:20,215
Because she came from you.

1615
02:32:31,768 --> 02:32:34,354
Oh, God. The vial.

1616
02:32:38,859 --> 02:32:40,360
You've been poisoned.

1617
02:32:42,070 --> 02:32:43,071
Yes.

1618
02:32:44,031 --> 02:32:45,282
There must be a way.

1619
02:32:49,953 --> 02:32:51,163
There must be a way.

1620
02:33:03,300 --> 02:33:04,968
We just need more time.

1621
02:33:06,011 --> 02:33:07,846
If we only had more time.

1622
02:33:13,643 --> 02:33:15,520
You have all the time in the world.

1623
02:33:19,691 --> 02:33:20,692
I love you.

1624
02:33:24,446 --> 02:33:25,864
I love you too.

1625
02:33:46,843 --> 02:33:48,553
She does have your eyes.

1626
02:33:52,349 --> 02:33:53,350
I know.

1627
02:34:07,697 --> 02:34:08,698
I know.

1628
02:35:13,388 --> 02:35:15,807
Very hard to know what to say,

1629
02:35:15,891 --> 02:35:19,853
but I thought we should gather
and remember.

1630
02:35:21,146 --> 02:35:22,481
And I...

1631
02:35:23,064 --> 02:35:27,277
I thought this was appropriate.

1632
02:35:31,531 --> 02:35:36,161
"The function of man is to live,
not to exist.

1633
02:35:38,830 --> 02:35:41,917
I shall not waste my days
trying to prolong them.

1634
02:35:43,210 --> 02:35:45,962
I shall use my time."

1635
02:35:58,183 --> 02:35:59,184
To James.

1636
02:36:00,519 --> 02:36:01,937
-James.
-James.

1637
02:36:02,020 --> 02:36:03,063
James.

1638
02:36:05,690 --> 02:36:06,691
James.

1639
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:17,786
Right. Back to work.

1640
02:36:34,678 --> 02:36:36,263
Mathilde.

1641
02:36:36,346 --> 02:36:37,389
Quoi?

1642
02:36:37,472 --> 02:36:39,057
I'm going to tell you a story...

1643
02:36:41,935 --> 02:36:43,019
about a man.

1644
02:36:43,853 --> 02:36:45,105
His name was Bond.

1645
02:36:47,148 --> 02:36:48,483
James Bond.
